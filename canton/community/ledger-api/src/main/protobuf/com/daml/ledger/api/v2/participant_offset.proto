// Describes a specific point on the participant. This is a participant local value:
// a participant offset is meaningful only in the context of its participant. Different
// participants may associate different offsets to the same change synchronized over a domain,
// and conversely, the same literal participant offset may refer to different changes on
// different participants.
//
// This is also a unique index of the changes which happened on the virtual shared ledger.
// Participant offset define an order, which is the same in which order the updates are
// visible as subscribing to the ``UpdateService``. This ordering is also a fully causal
// ordering for one specific domain: for two updates synchronized by the same domain, the
// one with a bigger participant offset happened after than the one with a smaller participant
// offset. Please note this is not true for updates synchronized by a different domain.
// Accordingly, the participant offset order may deviate from the order of the changes
// on the virtual shared ledger.
//
// The Ledger API endpoints that take offsets allow to specify portions
// of the participant that are relevant for the client to read.
//
// Offsets returned by the Ledger API can be used as-is (e.g.
// to keep track of processed transactions and provide a restart
// point to use in case of need).
//
// The format of absolute offsets is opaque to the client: no
// client-side transformation of an offset is guaranteed
// to return a meaningful offset.
//
// The server implementation ensures internally that offsets
// are lexicographically comparable.
