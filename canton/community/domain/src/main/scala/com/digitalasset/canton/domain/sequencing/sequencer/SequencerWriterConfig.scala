  * @param eventWriteBatchMaxDuration max duration to collect events for a batch before triggering a write.
  * @param commitMode optional commit mode that if set will be validated to ensure that the connection/db settings have been configured. Defaults to [[CommitMode.Synchronous]].
  * @param maxSqlInListSize will limit the number of items in a SQL in clause. useful for databases where this may have a low limit (e.g. Oracle).
