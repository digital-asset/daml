/** Although our integration tests are designed not to conflict with one another when running concurrently,
  * practically due to how resource heavy their setups are you will start encountering problems if we run
  * too many canton environments at once.
  * To prevent this we have a global limit on how many environments can be started concurrently.
  * NOTE: The limit is per class loader, therefore when running both enterprise and community integration tests, each
  * has their own limit as sbt creates a class loader per sub-project.
  * This defaults to 1 but can be overridden using the system property [[ConcurrentEnvironmentLimiter.IntegrationTestConcurrencyLimit]].
  * Integration test setups should create their environments within [[ConcurrentEnvironmentLimiter.create]]
  * and destroy them within [[ConcurrentEnvironmentLimiter.destroy]].
  * A semaphore is used to block creations until a permit is available, and then the permit is released after the environment is destroyed.
  *
  * Due to this approach tests will start but then be blocked until a permit is available. In some cases for many minutes.
  * This may well activate a slow poke notification in ScalaTest, however these are left in place to support discovery
  * of any tests that fail to halt entirely or run for an abnormally long amount of time.
