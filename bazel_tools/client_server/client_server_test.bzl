    """Create a client-server test.

    The rule takes a client and server executables and their
    arguments as parameters. The server port is passed via a
    temporary file, which is passed to the server executable via the
    "--port-file" parameter. This file is parsed and the port number
    is passed to the client application via the "--target-port" argument.

    The server process is killed after the client process exits.

    The client and server executables can be any Bazel target that
    is executable, e.g. scala_binary, sh_binary, etc.

    The client and server files must be valid arguments to rlocation, as
    can be obtained using $(rootpath ...) or $(rootpaths ...). (See
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html#predefined_label_variables.)
    Once expended using rlocation, those are simply appended to client
    and server arguments, respectively.

    Example:
      ```bzl
      client_server_test(
        name = "my_test",
        runner_args = [],
        client = ":my_client",
        client_args = ["--extra-argument"],
        client_files = ["$(rootpath :target-for-client)"]
        server = ":my_server",
        server_args = ["--fast"],
        server_files = ["$(rootpath :target-for-client)"]
      )
