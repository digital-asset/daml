### What do you think is bad about the error message?

<!--
- Is it simply wrong, in that it refers to the wrong code?
- Is it incomplete, in that it refers to only part of the problem?
- Is it confusing, in that it refers to complex features?
- Does it show compiler internals, or parts of the pipeline that you don't know about?
- Is it insufficient, because it doesn't provide advice?
-->

### What do you think could be done to improve the error message?

<!--
- If the error is simply wrong, should it be fixed?
- Should it provide better context on what caused the error?
- Does it obscure compiler internals and better explain the source of the error?
- Should it provide better advice on how to fix the error?
