/** A compatible layer for `scala.concurrent` with extra type parameters to
  * control `ExecutionContext`s.  Deliberately uses the same names as the
  * equivalent concepts in `scala.concurrent`.
  *
  * The trouble with [[sc.ExecutionContext]] is that it is used incoherently.
  * This leads to the problems described in
  * https://failex.blogspot.com/2020/05/global-typeclass-coherence-principles-3.html
  * .  The extension layer in this package adds a phantom type parameter to
  * `ExecutionContext` and related types, so that types can be used to
  * discriminate between ExecutionContexts at compile-time, and so Futures can
  * declare which ExecutionContext their operations are in.
  *
  * For Scala 2.12, you must pass `-Xsource:2.13` to scalac for methods and
  * conversions to be automatically found.  You must also `import
  * scalaz.syntax.bind._` or similar for Future methods like `map`, `flatMap`,
  * and so on.
  *
  * There are no constraints on the `EC` type variable; you need only declare
  * types you wish to use for it that are sufficient for describing the domains
  * in which you want ExecutionContexts to be discriminated.  These types will
  * never be instantiated, so you can simply declare that they exist.  They can
  * be totally separate, or have subtyping relationships; any subtyping
  * relationships they have will be reflected in equivalent subtyping
  * relationships between the resulting `ExecutionContext`s; if you declare
  * `sealed trait Elephant extends Animal`, then automatically
  * `ExecutionContext[Elephant] <: ExecutionContext[Animal]` with scalac
  * preferring the former when available (because it is "more specific").  They
  * can even be singleton types, so you might use `x.type` to suggest that the
  * context is associated with the exact value of the `x` variable.
  *
  * If you want to, say, refer to both [[sc.Future]] and [[concurrent.Future]]
  * in the same file, we recommend importing *the containing package* with an
  * alias rather than renaming each individual class you import.  For example,
  *
  * {{{
  *   import com.daml.concurrent._
  *   import scala.{concurrent => sc}
  *   // OR
  *   import scala.concurrent._
  *   import com.daml.{concurrent => dc}
  * }}}
  *
  * The exact name isn't important, but you should pick a short one that is
  * sufficiently suggestive for you.
  *
  * You should always be able to remove the substring `Of.Instance.T` from any
  * inferred type; we strongly suggest doing this for clarity.
  *
  * Demonstrations of the typing behavior can be found in FutureSpec and
  * ExecutionContextSpec.  This library has no interesting runtime
  * characteristics; you should think of it as exactly like `scala.concurrent`
  * in that regard.
