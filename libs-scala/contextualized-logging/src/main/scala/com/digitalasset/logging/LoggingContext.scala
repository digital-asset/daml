    * ## Principles to follow when enriching the logging context
    *
    * ### Don't add values coming from a scope outside of the current method
    *
    * If a method receives a value as a parameter, it should trust that,
    * if it was relevant, the caller already added this value to the context.
    * Add values to the context as upstream as possible in the call chain.
    * This ensures to not add duplicates, possibly using slightly different
    * names to track the same value. The context was implemented to ensure
    * that values did not have to be passed down the entire call stack to
    * be logged at relevant points.
    *
    * ### Don't dump string representations of complex objects
    *
    * The purpose of the context is to be consumed by structured logging
    * frameworks. Dumping the string representation of an object, like a
    * Scala case class instance, means embedding some form of string
    * formatting in another (likely to be JSON). This can be difficult
    * to manage and parse, so stick to simple values (strings, numbers,
    * dates, etc.).
