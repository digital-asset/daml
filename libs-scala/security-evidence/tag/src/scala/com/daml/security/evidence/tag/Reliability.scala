    * Generally, for a given failure or degradation of a component, the next dependent of the component which can remediate the failure
    * should be the component that should be tested/annotated to remain available. If the failing component 'itself'
    * can remediate the failure (e.g. when the active mediator crashes, the other passive replicated mediators will
    * remediate by becoming active), then the next dependent should be annotated as the component to remain available.
    *
    * For example, if the sequencer-database connection is blocked, then the component that should remain available
    * is the sequencer as next dependent. It should, e.g., not be the participant connected to the sequencer (which also wouldn't be able to
    * process transactions over that sequencer anymore) because the participant is not the next dependent.
    *
    * @param component the component that should remain available, continue processing or recover
    * @param dependencyFailure the failure scenario of a dependency and its remediation
    * @param remediation how the system remediates the adverse scenario
    * @param outcome in what way the component is still available, can continue operating or recovers
