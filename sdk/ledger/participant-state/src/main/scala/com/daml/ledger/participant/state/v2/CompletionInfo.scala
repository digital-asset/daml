/** Information about a completion for a submission.
  *
  * @param actAs                  the non-empty set of parties that submitted the change.
  * @param applicationId          an identifier for the Daml application that submitted the command.
  * @param commandId              a submitter-provided identifier to identify an intended ledger
  *                               change within all the submissions by the same parties and
  *                               application.
  * @param optDeduplicationPeriod The deduplication period that the [[WriteService]] actually uses
  *                               for the command submission. It may differ from the suggested
  *                               deduplication period given to [[WriteService.submitTransaction]].
  *
  *                               For example, the suggested deduplication period may have been
  *                               converted into a different kind or extended. The particular choice
  *                               depends on the particular implementation.
  *
  *                               This allows auditing the deduplication guarantee described in the
  *                               [[ReadService.stateUpdates]].
  *
  *                               Optional as some implementations may not be able to provide this
  *                               deduplication information. If an implementation does not provide
  *                               this deduplication information, it MUST adhere to the deduplication
  *                               guarantee under a sensible interpretation of the corresponding
  *                               [[CompletionInfo.optDeduplicationPeriod]].
  * @param submissionId           An identifier for the submission that allows an application to
  *                               correlate completions to its submissions.
  *
  *                               Optional as entries created by the participant.state.v1 API do not have this filled.
  *                               Only set for participant.state.v2 created entries
  *
  * @param statistics             The statistics that will be used by participant metering.
