Canton is a next-generation Daml ledger interoperability protocol that implements Daml's built-in models of
authorization and privacy faithfully.

* By partitioning the global state it solves both the privacy problems and the scaling bottlenecks of platforms such as
  a single Ethereum instance.

* It allows developers to balance auditability requirements with the right to forget, making it well-suited for building
  GDPR-compliant systems.

* Canton handles authentication and data transport through our so-called synchronizers.

* Synchronizers can be deployed at will to address scalability, operational or trust concerns.

* Synchronizers are permissioned but can be federated at no interoperability cost, yielding a virtual global ledger that
  enables truly global workflow composition.
