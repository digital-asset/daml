/** A version of [[NamedLoggerFactory]] that allows suppressing and intercepting warnings and errors in the log.
  * Intended for testing.
  *
  * Suppressed warnings and errors will still be logged, but with level `INFO` and the prefix `"Suppressed WARN: "`
  * or `"Suppressed ERROR: "`.
  *
  * The methods of this class will check whether the computation during which logging is suppressed yields a future.
  * If so, suppression will finish after completion of the future (instead of after creation of the future).
  *
  * Nested suppression / recording of log messages is not supported to keep the implementation simple.
  *
  * Only affects logging by Canton code.
  * To suppress logging in libraries configure a [[com.digitalasset.canton.logging.Rewrite]] rule in `logback-test.xml`.
  *
  * @param skipLogEntry Log entries satisfying this predicate are suppressed, but not included in the queue of suppressed log entries.
