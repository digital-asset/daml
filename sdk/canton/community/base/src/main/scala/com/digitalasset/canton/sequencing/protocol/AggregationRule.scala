/** Encodes the conditions on when an aggregatable submission request's envelopes are sequenced and delivered.
  *
  * Aggregatable submissions are grouped by their [[SubmissionRequest.aggregationId]].
  * An aggregatable submission's envelopes are delivered to their recipients when the [[threshold]]'s
  * submission request in its group has been sequenced. The aggregatable submission request that triggers the threshold
  * defines the sequencing timestamp (and thus the sequencer counters) for all delivered envelopes.
  * The sender of an aggregatable submission request receives a receipt of delivery immediately when its request was sequenced,
  * not when its envelopes were delivered. When the envelopes are actually delivered, no further delivery receipt is sent.
  *
  * So a threshold of 1 means that no aggregation takes place and the event is sequenced immediately.
  * In this case, one can completely omit the aggregation rule in the submission request.
