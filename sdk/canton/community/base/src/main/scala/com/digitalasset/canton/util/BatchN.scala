/** Forms dynamically-sized batches based on downstream backpressure.
  *   - Under light load, this flow emits batches of size 1.
  *   - Under moderate load, this flow emits batches according to the batch mode:
  *     - MaximizeConcurrency: emits batches of even sizes
  *     - MaximizeBatchSize: emits fewer but full batches
  *   - Under heavy load (dowstream saturated), this flow emits batches of `maxBatchSize`.
  *
  *   moderate load: short intermittent backpressure from downstream that doesn't fill up the
  *   maximum batch capacity (maxBatchSize * maxBatchCount) of BatchN.
  *
  *   heavy load: downstream backpressure causes the full batch capacity to fill up and BatchN to
  *   exert backpressure to upstream.
  *
  *   Under heavy load or when maxBatchCount == 1, CatchUpMode.MaximizeBatchSize and
  *   CatchupMode.MaximizeConcurrency behave the same way, i.e. full batches are emitted.
