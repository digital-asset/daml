/** Provides a variety of methods for tracking time on the domain.
  *  - fetchTime and fetchTimeProof allows for proactively asking for a recent time or time proof.
  *  - requestTick asks the tracker to ensure that an event is witnessed for the given time or greater (useful for timeouts).
  *  - awaitTick will return a future to wait for the given time being reached on the target domain.
  *
  * We currently assume that the domain and our host are roughly synchronized
  * and typically won't expect to see a time on a domain until we have passed that point on our local clock.
  * We then wait for `observationLatency` past the timestamp we are expecting to elapse on our local clock
  * as transmission of an event with that timestamp will still take some time to arrive at our host.
  * This avoids frequently asking for times before we've reached the timestamps we're looking for locally.
  *
  * We also take into account a `patienceDuration` that will cause us to defer asking for a time if we
  * have recently seen events for the domain. This is particularly useful if we are significantly behind and
  * reading many old events from the domain.
  *
  * If no activity is happening on the domain we will try to ensure that we have observed an event at least once
  * during the `minObservationDuration`.
