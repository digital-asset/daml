  // Here is how shutdown works:
  //   1. we stop injecting new events even if the handler is idle using the synchronizeWithClosingSync,
  //   2. the synchronous processing will mark handlerIdle as not completed, and once started, will be added to the flush
  //      the synchronizeWithClosingSync will guard us from entering the close method (and starting to flush) before we've successfully
  //      registered with the flush future
  //   3. once the synchronous processing finishes, it will mark the `handlerIdle` as completed and complete the flush future
  //   4. before the synchronous processing terminates and before it marks the handler to be idle again,
  //      it will add the async processing to the flush future.
  //   Consequently, on shutdown, we first have to wait on the flush future.
  //     a. No synchronous event will be added to the flush future anymore by the signalHandler
  //        due to the synchronizeWithClosingSync. Therefore, we can be sure that once the flush future terminates
  //        during shutdown, that the synchronous processing has completed and nothing new has been added.
  //     b. However, the synchronous event processing will be adding async processing to the flush future in the
  //        meantime. This means that the flush future we are waiting on might be outdated.
  //        Therefore, we have to wait on the flush future again. We can then be sure that all asynchronous
  //        futures have been added in the meantime as the synchronous flush future finished.
  //     c. I (rv) think that waiting on the `handlerIdle` is a unnecessary for shutdown as it does the
  //        same as the flush future. We only need it to ensure we don't start the sequential processing in parallel.
