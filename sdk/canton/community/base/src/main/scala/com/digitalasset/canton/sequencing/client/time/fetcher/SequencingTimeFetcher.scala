  // Given a sequencing time, we want to know if at least one non-faulty sequencer node has reached it
  //  (i.e., if any subsequent send will be assigned a later sequencing time).
  //
  //  A negative outcome is however considered safe because in that case we'll retry, so false negatives
  //  are not a correctness problem; this means that a large number of unresponsive nodes can be tolerated.
  //
  //  Let `f` = maximum tolerated number of nodes that can be faulty in arbitrary ways, i.e., `trustThreshold` - 1.
  //
  //  In order to make sure that at least one non-faulty node has reached the given time, we must find
  //  at least additional `f` nodes that have also reached it, i.e., `f+1` in total.
  //  This is because in the worst case `f` nodes may be maliciously colluding and causing a false positive answer
  //  (e.g., their `GetTime` could always return `CantonTimestamp.MaxValue`), and in that case we need
  //  another `f` replies agreeing with the correct node to outvote the malicious ones.
  //
  //  This means that in the worst case, under the trust assumption of up to `f` non-compliant nodes,
  //  we may end up querying `2f+1` nodes.
  //
  //  Since connections are not exclusive, however, we can just ask for one connection per sequencer
  //  and have the best possible pool at our disposal, so our strategy is to try and reach `f+1` positive
  //  outcomes, potentially by ending up querying all available sequencers.
  //  This allows tolerating a large number of unresponsive nodes.
