/** Ensures orderly shutdown for a set of [[LifeCycleManager.ManagedResource]]s and dependent
  * [[LifeCycleManager]]s. This creates a shutdown hierarchy.
  *
  * When a [[LifeCycleManager]] is closed with [[LifeCycleManager.closeAsync]], the following
  * shutdown procedure is applied:
  *   1. '''Close signal propagation''': The [[LifeCycleManager]] and all its dependent
  *      [[LifeCycleManager]]s are notified that closing is in progress. Thereafter, their
  *      [[HasRunOnClosing.isClosing]] returns true. Transitive dependents are also notified, but
  *      this need not be synchronized with the next step.
  *   1. '''Run on closing''': The [[RunOnClosing]] tasks registered with the [[LifeCycleManager]].
  *      Exceptions from the [[RunOnClosing]] tasks are logged and then discarded. The dependent
  *      [[LifeCycleManager]]s also start running their [[RunOnClosing]] tasks.
  *   1. '''Synchronize with closing''': The [[LifeCycleManager]] waits until all its
  *      [[HasSynchronizeWithClosing.synchronizeWithClosing]] computations have finished or until
  *      [[LifeCycleManager.synchronizeWithClosingPatience]] has elapsed.
  *   1. '''Release''': The [[LifeCycleManager]] releases all its
  *      [[LifeCycleManager.ManagedResource]]s and instructs dependent [[LifeCycleManager]]s to do
  *      so in ascending priority order. Within the same priority, releasing is unordered and
  *      possibly in parallel. When a dependent [[LifeCycleManager]] is instructed, it waits until
  *      step 2 has finished and then performs steps 3 and 4 of this procedure.
  *
  * Exceptions thrown in the last step "release" are propagated as a [[ShutdownFailedException]]
  * with proper exception chaining. If the third step completes because the patience has elapsed and
  * some [[HasSynchronizeWithClosing.synchronizeWithClosing]] computations are still running at the
  * end of the last step, a [[ShutdownFailedException]] signals such a synchronization failure.
  *
  * Rationale for this exception handling policy:
  *   - When an exception happens in the last step, it is unknown whether all dependencies have
  *     successfully finished all their business. So we must signal to the caller that the
  *     unexpected happened.
  *   - When some [[HasSynchronizeWithClosing.synchronizeWithClosing]] is still running after
  *     everything has been released, we cannot guarantee that all side effects guarded by this
  *     shutdown hierarchy are over. We signal this to the caller via an exception.
  *   - In contrast, [[RunOnClosing]] tasks are meant to quickly clean up stuff upon closing. They
  *     are not synchronized with closing, and therefore we merely log exceptions, but do not
  *     propagate them.

    * Closing for a [[LifeCycleManager.root]] manager is simple: [[LifeCycleManager.closeAsync]]
    * merely goes through the prescribed protocol. For a [[LifeCycleManager.dependent]] manager,
    * this manager registers itself via several [[LifeCycleManagerTask]]s with the `parent` manager
    * as part of the constructor. This then leads to three different possible paths through closing:
    *   1. An explicit call to [[LifeCycleManager.closeAsync]]. This is only possible once the
    *      manager has been fully constructed (as no reference to `this` should escape from the
    *      constructor).
    *   1. An invocation of the registered [[LifeCycleManagerTask]]s by the parent manager.
    *   1. A failure to register the [[LifeCycleManagerTask]]s with the `parent` manager because the
    *      `parent` manager has already been closed. In this case, this manager closes itself
    *      immediately during construction, too.
    *
    * The first path to set the closing flag is the one responsible for fully carrying out the
    * shutdown procedure. The other paths merely synchronize with this one to the extent required.
    * Note that all paths can interleave due to concurrent invocations except for 1 and 3.
