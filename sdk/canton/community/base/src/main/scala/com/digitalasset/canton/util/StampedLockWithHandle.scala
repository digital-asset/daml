/** A stamped lock that allows passing around a lock handle to better guard methods

  *
  * For example:
  *
  * <pre>
  * object Foo {
  *   val lock = new StampedLockWithHandle()
  *
  *   def bar() = lockWithWriteLockHandle { implicit writeLock =>
  *     // do something

  *   }
  * }
  * </pre>
  *
  * In the above example, `baz` cannot be called unless a write lock
  * was acquired specifically only with `lock`.
