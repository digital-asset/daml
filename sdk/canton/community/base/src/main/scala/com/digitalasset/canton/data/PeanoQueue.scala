/** A Peano priority queue is a mutable priority queue of key-value pairs with ordered keys,
  * starting from an index called the head,
  * where pairs may be added in any order,
  * but are polled strictly in their natural sequence.
  * The order on keys must be a linear sequence,
  * i.e., isomorphic to the order on a possibly unbounded interval of the integers.
  * If the priority queue is missing a key from the sequence, we cannot poll that key
  * until a key-value pair for that key is added.
  *
  * For example, in a priority queue with head 1, the keys polled are 1, then 2, then 3, etc.
  *
  * The head index is mutable, and increments each time the priority queue is successfully polled.
  * Keys are unique and their value associations may not be modified.
  *
  * @tparam K The type of keys
  * @tparam V The type of values
