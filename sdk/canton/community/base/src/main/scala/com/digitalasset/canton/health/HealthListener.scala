    * Implementations must be thread-safe in the sense that multiple notifications can run concurrently.
    * Implementations must not block and should not execute significant computations as part of this call.
    * In particular, it is wrong to assume that the listener has finished its updates by the time
    * this method returns.
    *
    * We explicitly do NOT pass along the new state of the health element nor the health element itself.
    * Instead, the listener must query the current state using [[HealthElement.getState]].
    * This ensures that we do not need to synchronize concurrent updates and notifications;
    * the state obtained [[HealthElement.getState]] is guaranteed to be at least as up to date as the notification.
