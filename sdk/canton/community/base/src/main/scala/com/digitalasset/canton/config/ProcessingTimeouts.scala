/** Configuration for internal await timeouts
  *
  * @param unbounded timeout on how long "unbounded" operations can run. should be infinite in theory.
  * @param io timeout for disk based operations
  * @param default default finite processing timeout
  * @param network timeout for things related to networking
  * @param shutdownProcessing timeout used for shutdown of some processing where we'd like to keep the result (long)
  * @param shutdownNetwork timeout used for shutdown where we interact with some remote system
  * @param shutdownShort everything else shutdown releated (default)
  * @param closing our closing time (which should be strictly larger than any of the shutdown values)
  * @param verifyActive how long should we wait for the synchronizer to tell us whether we are active or not
  * @param inspection timeout for the storage inspection commands (can run a long long time)
  * @param storageMaxRetryInterval max retry interval for storage
  * @param activeInit how long a passive replica should wait for the initialization by the active replica
  * @param slowFutureWarn when using future supervision, when should we start to warn about a slow future
  * @param activeInitRetryDelay delay between attempts while waiting for initialization of the active replica
  * @param sequencerInfo how long are we going to try to get the sequencer connection information. setting this high means that
  *                      connect calls will take quite a while if one of the sequencers is offline.
  * @param topologyChangeWarnDelay maximum delay between the timestamp of the topology snapshot used during
  *                                submission and the sequencing timestamp, after which we log inconsistency
  *                                errors as warnings
  * @param sequencedEventProcessingBound Maximum time we allow for locally processing a sequenced event.
  *                                      If local processing takes longer, the node will emit an error or crash.
