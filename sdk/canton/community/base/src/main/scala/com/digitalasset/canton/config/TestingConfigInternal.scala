/** Used to set parameters for testing when these don't need to be exposed in a config file.
  *
  * @param testSequencerClientFor: members that should use a
  * [[com.digitalasset.canton.sequencing.client.DelayedSequencerClient]] for testing
  * @param supportAdhocMetrics  if true, then creating adhoc metrics is supported (conflicts with histogram redefinitions)
  * @param initializeGlobalOpenTelemetry Determines whether the OpenTelemetry instance we build is set as the global OpenTelemetry instance. This is set to false during tests to
  *                                      prevent failures as the global OpenTelemetry instance can be initialized just once.
  * @param doNotUseCommitmentCachingFor A participant whose participant.uid.identifier that matches one of these strings will be excluded from the commitment caching.
  * @param reinterpretationTestHookFor Hooks allowing participants to perform actions during reinterpretation interruptions.
  *                                    The argument to pass is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns
  *                                    the hook for the corresponding member whose identifier matches the string.
  *                                    The hook itself is a function that takes no argument and returns `Unit`.
  *                                    The default value provides hooks that do nothing for all members.
  *
  *                                    Example:
  *                                    {{{
  *                                    def myHooks(identifier: String): () => Unit =
  *                                      identifier match {
  *                                        case "participant1" => () => println(s"do something special for `participant1`")
  *                                        case _ => () => println(s"no action")
  *                                      }
  *                                    }}}
  *
  *                                    See also the example in `EngineComputationAbortIntegrationTest`.
  * @param maxCommitmentSendDelayMillis The maximum delay for sending commitments in milliseconds. If not set,
  *                                     commitment sending is delayed by a random amount at most the default value.
  * @param sequencerTransportSeed The seed to be used for choosing threshold number of sequencer transports.
  * @param warnOnAcsCommitmentDegradation When true, we log a warning when the participant falls behind in
  *                                       producing ACS commitments. This is the default.
  *                                       A false value lowers the logging level to debug, while keeping the degradation
  *                                       of the health status. In tests, we should set it to false, because any test
  *                                       with high load can cause a participant to lag behind in producing
  *                                       commitments, which would produce an ACS commitment degradation warning and
  *                                       cause a CI test to be reported as failed. Because in our testing framework any
  *                                       test can run colocated with any other test, any test, load-intensive or not,
  *                                       can issue the warning. Therefore, this parameter should be set to false in
  *                                       tests, unless the test expressly checks the behavior of the degradation.
