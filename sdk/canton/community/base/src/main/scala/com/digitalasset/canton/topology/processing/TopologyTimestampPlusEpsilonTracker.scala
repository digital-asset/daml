/** Computes the effective timestamps of topology transactions
  *
  * Transaction validation and processing depends on the topology state at the given sequencing time.
  * If topology transactions became effective immediately,
  * we would have to inspect every event first if there is a topology state and wait until all
  * the topology processing has finished before evaluating the transaction. This would cause a sequential bottleneck.
  *
  * To avoid this bottleneck, topology transactions become effective only in the future at an "effective time", where
  * effective time >= sequencingTime + synchronizerParameters.topologyChangeDelay.
  *
  * However, the synchronizerParameters can change and so can the topologyChangeDelay.
  * So it is non-trivial to apply the right topologyChangeDelay. Also, if the topologyChangeDelay is decreased,
  * the effective timestamps of topology transactions could "run backwards", which would break topology management.
  *
  * This class computes the effective timestamps of topology transactions from their sequencing timestamps.
  * It makes sure that effective timestamps are strictly monotonically increasing.
  * For better performance, it keeps the current as well as all future topologyChangeDelays in memory, so that all
  * computations can be performed without reading from the database.
