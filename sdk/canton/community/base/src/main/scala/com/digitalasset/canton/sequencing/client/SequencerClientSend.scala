trait SequencerClientSend {

  /** Sends a request to sequence a deliver event to the sequencer.
    * If we fail to make the request to the sequencer and are certain that it was not received by the sequencer an
    * error is returned. In this circumstance it is safe for the caller to retry the request without causing a duplicate
    * request.
    * A successful response however does not mean that the request will be successfully sequenced. Instead the caller
    * must subscribe to the sequencer and can observe one of the following outcomes:
    *   1. A deliver event is sequenced with a messageId matching this send.
    *   2. A deliver error is sequenced with a messageId matching this send.
    *   3. The sequencing time progresses beyond the provided max-sequencing-time. The caller can assume that the send
    *      will now never be sequenced.
    * Callers should be aware that a message-id can be reused once one of these outcomes is observed so cannot assume
    * that an event with a matching message-id at any point in the future matches their send. Use the `sendTracker` to
    * aid tracking timeouts for events (if useful this could be enriched in the future to provide send completion
    * callbacks alongside the existing timeout notifications).
    * For convenience callers can provide a callback that the SendTracker will invoke when the outcome of the send
    * is known. However this convenience comes with significant limitations that a caller must understand:
    *  - the callback has no ability to be persisted so will be lost after a restart or recreation of the SequencerClient
    *  - the callback is called by the send tracker while handling an event from a SequencerSubscription.
    *    If the callback returns an error this will be returned to the underlying subscription handler and shutdown the sequencer
    *    client. If handlers do not want to halt the sequencer subscription errors should be appropriately handled
    *    (particularly logged) and a successful value returned from the callback.
    *  - If witnessing an event causes many prior sends to timeout there is no guaranteed order in which the
    *    callbacks of these sends will be notified.
    *  - If replay is enabled, the callback will be called immediately with a fake `SendResult`.
    *  - When the send tracker is closed, the callback will be called immediately with AbortedDueToShutdown.
    *  - the closing of objects should not synchronize with the completion of the callback via performUnlessClosing
    *    unless the synchronized object is responsible for closing the sequencer client itself (possibly transitively).
    *    Otherwise shutdown deadlocks are to be expected between the synchronized object and the send tracker or sequencer client.
    *  For more robust send result tracking callers should persist metadata about the send they will make and
    *  monitor the sequenced events when read, so actions can be taken even if in-memory state is lost.
    *
    *  @param amplify Amplification sends the submission request to multiple sequencers according to the
    *                 [[com.digitalasset.canton.sequencing.SubmissionRequestAmplification]] configured in the
    *                 [[com.digitalasset.canton.sequencing.SequencerConnections]]. If the sequencer client plans to send
    *                 the submission request to multiple sequencers, it adds a suitable
    *                 [[com.digitalasset.canton.sequencing.protocol.AggregationRule]] to the request for deduplication,
    *                 unless one is already present.
    *                 False disables amplificaton for this request independent of the configuration.
