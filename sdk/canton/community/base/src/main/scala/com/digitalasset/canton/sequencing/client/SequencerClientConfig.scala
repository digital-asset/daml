/** Client configured options for how to connect to a sequencer
  *
  * @param eventInboxSize The size of the inbox queue used to store received events. Must be at least one.
  *                       Events in the inbox are processed in parallel.
  *                       A larger inbox may result in higher throughput at the price of higher memory consumption,
  *                       larger database queries, and longer crash recovery.
  * @param startupConnectionRetryDelay Initial delay before we attempt to establish an initial connection
  * @param initialConnectionRetryDelay Initial delay before a reconnect attempt
  * @param warnDisconnectDelay Consider sequencer to be degraded after delay
  * @param maxConnectionRetryDelay Maximum delay before a reconnect attempt
  * @param handshakeRetryAttempts How many attempts should we make to get a handshake response
  * @param handshakeRetryDelay How long to delay between attempts to fetch a handshake response
  * @param defaultMaxSequencingTimeOffset if no max-sequencing-time is supplied to send, our current time will be offset by this amount
  * @param acknowledgementInterval Controls how frequently the client acknowledges how far it has successfully processed
  *                                to the sequencer which allows the sequencer to remove this data when pruning.
  * @param keepAliveClient keep alive config used for GRPC sequencers
  * @param authToken configuration settings for the authentication token manager
  * @param skipSequencedEventValidation if true, sequenced event validation will be skipped. the default setting is false.
  *                                     this option should only be enabled if a defective validation is blocking processing.
  *                                     therefore, unless you know what you are doing, you shouldn't touch this setting.
  * @param overrideMaxRequestSize overrides the maxRequestSize configured in the dynamic synchronizer parameters. If overrideMaxRequestSize,
  *                               is set, modifying the maxRequestSize won't have any effect.
  * @param maximumInFlightEventBatches The maximum number of event batches that the system will process concurrently.
  * Setting the `maximumInFlightEventBatches` parameter limits the number of event batches that the system will process
  * simultaneously, preventing overload and ensuring that the system can handle the workload effectively. A higher value
  * of `maximumInFlightEventBatches` can lead to increased throughput, but at the cost of higher memory consumption and
  * longer processing times for each batch. A lower value of `maximumInFlightEventBatches` may limit throughput, but can
  * result in more stable and predictable system behavior.
