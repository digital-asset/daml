/** The member message handler represents one side/member of a sequencer channel on the sequencer channel service
  * and forwards messages from the member to another "recipient" member message handler.
  *
  * To prevent log noise arising from GRPC StreamObserver exceptions, the handler tracks the lifetime of its
  * bidirectional GRPC request according to GRPC semantics:
  * - an inbound onError call on the member observer stops the ability to send messages via the response observer
  * - an outbound onComplete call on the member observer (forwarded to the recipient member message handler) limits the time
  *   for the recipient member message handler to complete the opposite direction. (Even when the recipient's channel client
  *   completes the opposite side of the channel immediately in response to an inbound onComplete, the recipient's
  *   onComplete reaction is not forwarded to the sequencer channel service "about half the time".) This in part
  *   motivates the decision to complete the overall sequencer channel the moment either side of the channel calls
  *   onComplete.
  *
  * Lifetime tracking also notifies the GrpcSequencerChannel when the handler has completed its work.
  *
  * @param member                         The member associated with this member message handler.
  * @param responseObserver               The GRPC response observer sending responses to this member message handler's client.
  * @param recipientMemberMessageHandler  The "recipient" member message handler to whom this handler forwards requests.
  * @param onHandlerCompleted             Callback to notify the sequencer channel when this handler has completed.
