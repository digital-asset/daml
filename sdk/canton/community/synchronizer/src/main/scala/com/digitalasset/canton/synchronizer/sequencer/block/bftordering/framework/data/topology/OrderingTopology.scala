    //  quorum in the current topology.
    //
    //  For that, we need to count 1. the possible outcomes, 2. the "favorable" outcomes, i.e. the ones that
    //  yield a valid quorum in the current topology, and FP-divide the latter by the former.

    //
    //  The favorable outcomes are all the disseminations that also yield a valid (weak) quorum in the current
    //  topology.
    //
    //  An "outcome" here behaves like an ordered sequence obtained by sampling `k` times without repetition
    //  (as nodes can vote only once) from a certain set of nodes of size `n`, i.e., according to combinatorics,
    //  `permutations(n, k)`.
    //

    //
    //  1. If the previous and current topologies have the same quorum size, then no single vote can be wasted,
    //     so the favorable outcomes are thus only the ones from votes in shared peers,

    //     `sharedPeersThatHaveNotVotedYet`.

    //  2. If the previous topology has a bigger quorum, the favorable outcomes will also include
    //     further votes from the previous topology that are not needed to reach the quorum.
    //
    //     For example, if `numberOfVotesToGoInPreviousTopology - numberOfVotesToGoInCurrentTopology = 1`
    //     and 2 are missing in the previous topology, the favorable outcomes will be all samples without repetition
    //     consisting of 2 votes, that are either:
    //
    //     - `2 = numberOfVotesToGoInPreviousTopology` samples without repetition from the set of shared peers that
    //       have not voted yet, i.e., `numberOfOutcomesOnlyFromAvailableVotesInSharedPeers`
    //
    //     or
    //
    //     - Split into 2 sets of partial outcomes, such that partial outcomes in the first set are independent from
    //       partial outcomes in the second sets, as follows:
    //
    //       a. `1 = numberOfVotesToGoInCurrentTopology` samples without repetition from the set of shared peers that
    //         have not voted yet, i.e., `numberOfPartialOutcomesOnlyFromAvailableVotesInSharedPeers`.
    //       b. `1 = numberOfVotesToGoInPreviousTopology - numberOfVotesToGoInCurrentTopology`, i.e., the remaining
    //         votes samples without repetition from the set of peers in the previous topology that are not shared
    //         and haven't voted yet, i.e., `numberOfPartialOutcomesOnlyFromAvailableVotesNotInSharedPeers`
    //
    //     Sets `a` and `b` of partial outcomes have to be composed to produce a set of complete outcomes,
    //     which means that all ordered sequences of votes from set `a` must be concatenated with all ordered
    //     sequences of votes from set `b`, but also vice versa.
    //
    //     This composition has thus the cardinality of `cartesian_product(a, b) \union cartesian_product(b, a)`,
