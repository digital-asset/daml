// The trick to have opaque subtypes of JVM-native types in Scala 2 is relatively simple:
//  provide only a constraint on the type without defining it explicitly, and construct it
//  via `asInstanceOf` from the concrete type.
//  Opaque subtypes of JVM-native types are erased at runtime (check the bytecode), so they
//  don't have any runtime overhead.
//
//  However, subtypes of `Int` are annoying because Scala seems to assume that they are actually subtypes of `Long`
//  as soon as any operation is done on them, e.g., with `T <: Int`, `T(0) + 1` ends up being a `Long`.
