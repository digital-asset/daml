      fieldComments:
        created_event: |-
          Required
          The event as it appeared in the context of its last update (i.e. daml transaction or
          reassignment). In particular, the last offset, node_id pair is preserved.
          The last update is the most recent update created or assigned this contract on synchronizer_id synchronizer.
          The offset of the CreatedEvent might point to an already pruned update, therefore it cannot necessarily be used
          for lookups.
        synchronizer_id: |-
          A valid synchronizer id
          Required
        reassignment_counter: |-
          Each corresponding assigned and unassigned event has the same reassignment_counter. This strictly increases
          with each unassign command for the same contract. Creation of the contract corresponds to reassignment_counter
          equals zero.
          This field will be the reassignment_counter of the latest observable activation event on this synchronizer, which is
          before the active_at_offset.
          Required

        identity_provider_id: |-
          The id of the ``Identity Provider``
          Optional, if not set, assume the party is managed by the default identity provider or party is not hosted by the participant.
        synchronizer_id: |-
          The synchronizer, on which the party should be allocated.
          For backwards compatibility, this field may be omitted, if the participant is connected to only one synchronizer.
          Otherwise a synchronizer must be specified.

          Optional
        node_id: |-
          The position of this event in the originating transaction or reassignment.
          Node IDs are not necessarily equal across participants,
          as these may see different projections/parts of transactions.
          Required, must be valid node ID (non-negative integer)
        witness_parties: |-
          The parties that are notified of this event. For an ``ArchivedEvent``,
          these are the intersection of the stakeholders of the contract in
          question and the parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter``. The
          stakeholders are the union of the signatories and the observers of
          the contract.

      comments: A composite command that groups multiple commands together.
      fieldComments:
        command_id: |-
          Uniquely identifies the command.
          The triple (user_id, act_as, command_id) constitutes the change ID for the intended ledger change,
          where act_as is interpreted as a set of party names.
          The change ID can be used for matching the intended ledger changes with all their completions.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required
        synchronizer_id: |-

          Uniquely identifies the participant user that issued the command.
          Must be a valid UserIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required unless authentication is used with a user token.
          In that case, the token's user-id will be used for the request's user_id.
        prefetch_contract_keys: |-
          Fetches the contract keys into the caches to speed up the command processing.
          Should only contain contract keys that are expected to be resolved during interpretation of the commands.
          Keys of disclosed contracts do not need prefetching.

          Optional
        min_ledger_time_abs: |-
          Lower bound for the ledger time assigned to the resulting transaction.
          Note: The ledger time of a transaction is assigned as part of command interpretation.
          Use this property if you expect that command interpretation will take a considerate amount of time, such that by
          the time the resulting transaction is sequenced, its assigned ledger time is not valid anymore.
          Must not be set at the same time as min_ledger_time_rel.
          Optional
        deduplication_offset: |-
          Specifies the start of the deduplication period by a completion stream offset (exclusive).
          Must be a valid absolute offset (positive integer) or participant begin (zero).
        workflow_id: |-
          Identifier of the on-ledger workflow that this command is a part of.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Optional
        min_ledger_time_rel: |-
          Same as min_ledger_time_abs, but specified as a duration, starting from the time the command is received by the server.
          Must not be set at the same time as min_ledger_time_abs.
          Optional
        commands: |-
          Individual elements of this atomic command. Must be non-empty.
          Required
        submission_id: |-
          A unique identifier to distinguish completions for different submissions with the same change ID.
          Typically a random UUID. Applications are expected to use a different UUID for each retry of a submission
          with the same change ID.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).

          If omitted, the participant or the committer may set a value of their choice.
          Optional
        package_id_selection_preference: |-

          package names and interface instances in command submission and interpretation
        deduplication_duration: |-
          Specifies the length of the deduplication period.
          It is interpreted relative to the local clock at some point during the submission's processing.
          Must be non-negative. Must not exceed the maximum deduplication time.
        read_as: |-
          Set of parties on whose behalf (in addition to all parties listed in ``act_as``) contracts can be retrieved.
          This affects Daml operations such as ``fetch``, ``fetchByKey``, ``lookupByKey``, ``exercise``, and ``exerciseByKey``.
          Note: A participant node of a Daml network can host multiple parties. Each contract present on the participant
          node is only visible to a subset of these parties. A command can only use contracts that are visible to at least
          one of the parties in ``act_as`` or ``read_as``. This visibility check is independent from the Daml authorization
          rules for fetch operations.
          If ledger API authorization is enabled, then the authorization metadata must authorize the sender of the request
          to read contract data on behalf of each of the given parties.
          Optional
        act_as: |-
          Set of parties on whose behalf the command should be executed.
          If ledger API authorization is enabled, then the authorization metadata must authorize the sender of the request
          to act on behalf of each of the given parties.

          The ID of the succeeded or failed command.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required
        deduplication_duration: |-
          Specifies the length of the deduplication period.
          It is measured in record time of completions.

          Must be non-negative.
        update_id: |-
          The update_id of the transaction or reassignment that resulted from the command with command_id.
          Only set for successfully executed commands.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
        act_as: |-
          The set of parties on whose behalf the commands were executed.
          Contains the ``act_as`` parties from ``commands.proto``
          filtered to the requesting parties in CompletionStreamRequest.
          The order of the parties need not be the same as in the submission.
          Each element must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Optional for historic completions where this data is not available.

          Must be a valid UserIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Optional for historic completions where this data is not available.
        offset: |-
          May be used in a subsequent CompletionStreamRequest to resume the consumption of this stream at a later time.
          Required, must be a valid absolute offset (positive integer).
        status: |-
          Identifies the exact type of the error.
          It uses the same format of conveying error details as it is used for the RPC responses of the APIs.
          Optional
        deduplication_offset: |-
          Specifies the start of the deduplication period by a completion stream offset (exclusive).

          Must be a valid absolute offset (positive integer) or participant begin (zero).
        submission_id: |-
          The submission ID this completion refers to, as described in ``commands.proto``.

          Optional
        synchronizer_time: |-
          The synchronizer along with its record time.
          The synchronizer id provided, in case of

          - successful/failed transactions: identifies the synchronizer of the transaction
          - for successful/failed unassign commands: identifies the source synchronizer
          - for successful/failed assign commands: identifies the target synchronizer

          Required
        trace_context: |-
          Optional; ledger API trace context

          The trace context transported in this message corresponds to the trace context supplied
          by the client application in a HTTP2 header of the original command submission.
          We typically use a header to transfer this type of information. Here we use message
          body, because it is used in gRPC streams which do not support per message headers.
          This field will be populated with the trace context contained in the original submission.
          If that was not provided, a unique ledger-api-server generated trace context will be used
          instead.
  CompletionStreamRequest:

          Must be a valid UserIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required unless authentication is used with a user token.
          In that case, the token's user-id will be used for the request's user_id.
        parties: |-
          Non-empty list of parties whose data should be included.
          The stream shows only completions of commands for which at least one of the ``act_as`` parties is in the given set of parties.
          Must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required
        begin_exclusive: |-
          This optional field indicates the minimum offset for completions. This can be used to resume an earlier completion stream.
          If not set the ledger uses the ledger begin offset instead.
          If specified, it must be a valid absolute offset (positive integer) or zero (ledger begin offset).
          If the ledger has been pruned, this parameter must be specified and greater than the pruning offset.

        interface_views: |-
          Interface views specified in the transaction filter.
          Includes an ``InterfaceView`` for each interface for which there is a ``InterfaceFilter`` with

          the parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter`` that are informees
          of the event. If served as part of a ACS delta transaction those will
          be limited to all parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter`` that
          are stakeholders of the contract (i.e. either signatories or observers).
          If the ``CreatedEvent`` is returned as part of an AssignedEvent,
          ActiveContract or IncompleteUnassigned (so the event is related to
          an assignment or unassignment): this will include all parties of the
          ``TransactionFilter`` that are stakeholders of the contract.

          The behavior of reading create events visible to parties not hosted
          on the participant node serving the Ledger API is undefined. Concretely,
          there is neither a guarantee that the participant node will serve all their
          create events on the ACS stream, nor is there a guarantee that matching archive
          events are delivered for such create events.

          For most clients this is not a problem, as they only read events for parties
          that are hosted on the participant node. If you need to read events
          for parties that may not be hosted at all times on the participant node,
          subscribe to the ``TopologyEvent``s for that party by setting a corresponding
          ``UpdateFormat``.  Using these events, query the ACS as-of an offset where the
          party is hosted on the participant node, and ignore create events at offsets
          where the party is not hosted on the participant node.

  Event:
    message:
      comments: |-
        Events in transactions can have two primary shapes:

        - ACS delta: events can be CreatedEvent or ArchivedEvent
        - ledger effects: events can be CreatedEvent or ExercisedEvent

        In the update service the events are restricted to the events
        visible for the parties specified in the transaction filter. Each
        event message type below contains a ``witness_parties`` field which
        indicates the subset of the requested parties that can see the event
        in question.
      fieldComments:
        created: |-
          The event as it appeared in the context of its original daml transaction on this participant node.

        exercised: ''
  EventFormat:
    message:
      comments: |-
        A format for events which defines both which events should be included
        and what data should be computed and included for them.

        Note that some of the filtering behavior depends on the `TransactionShape`,
        which is expected to be specified alongside usages of `EventFormat`.
      fieldComments:
        filters_by_party: |-
          Each key must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          The interpretation of the filter depends on the transaction-shape being filtered:

          1. For **ledger-effects** create and exercise events are returned, for which the witnesses include at least one of
             the listed parties and match the per-party filter.
          2. For **transaction and active-contract-set streams** create and archive events are returned for all contracts whose
             stakeholders include at least one of the listed parties and match the per-party filter.

          Optional
        filters_for_any_party: |-
          Wildcard filters that apply to all the parties existing on the participant. The interpretation of the filters is the same
          with the per-party filter as described above.
          Optional
        verbose: |-
          If enabled, values served over the API will contain more information than strictly necessary to interpret the data.
          In particular, setting the verbose flag to true triggers the ledger to include labels for record fields.

          If not consuming, the witnesses are the union of the signatories and
          the actors. Note that the actors might not necessarily be observers
          and thus signatories. This is the case when the controllers of a

          Specifies the upper boundary of the node ids of the events in the same transaction that appeared as a result of
          this ``ExercisedEvent``. This allows unambiguous identification of all the members of the subtree rooted at this
          node. A full subtree can be constructed when all descendant nodes are present in the stream. If nodes are heavily
          filtered, it is only possible to determine if a node is in a consequent subtree or not.

        page_token: |-
          Pagination token to determine the specific page to fetch. Using the token guarantees that parties on a subsequent
          page are all lexically greater than the last party on a previous page. Server does not store intermediate results
          between calls chained by a series of page tokens. As a consequence, if new parties are being added and a page is
          requested twice using the same token, more parties can be returned on the second call.

          If the page_size exceeds the maximum supported by the server, an error will be returned. To obtain the server's
          maximum consult the PartyManagementFeature descriptor available in the VersionService.

          Lower bound for the ledger time assigned to the resulting transaction.
          The ledger time of a transaction is assigned as part of command interpretation.
          Important note: for interactive submissions, if the transaction depends on time, it **must** be signed
          and submitted within a time window around the ledger time assigned to the transaction during the prepare method.
          The time delta around that ledger time is a configuration of the ledger, usually short, around 1 minute.
          If however the transaction does not depend on time, the available time window to sign and submit the transaction is bound
          by the submission timestamp, which is also assigned in the "prepare" step (this request),
          but can be configured with a much larger skew, allowing for more time to sign the request (in the order of hours).

      comments: |-
        Represents metadata corresponding to a participant resource (e.g. a participant user or participant local information about a party).

        Based on ``ObjectMeta`` meta used in Kubernetes API.
        See https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/master/pkg/apis/meta/v1/generated.proto#L640
      fieldComments:
        resource_version: |-
          An opaque, non-empty value, populated by a participant server which represents the internal version of the resource
          this ``ObjectMeta`` message is attached to. The participant server will change it to a unique value each time the corresponding resource is updated.
          You must not rely on the format of resource version. The participant server might change it without notice.
          You can obtain the newest resource version value by issuing a read request.
          You may use it for concurrent change detection by passing it back unmodified in an update request.
          The participant server will then compare the passed value with the value maintained by the system to determine
          if any other updates took place since you had read the resource version.
          Upon a successful update you are guaranteed that no other update took place during your read-modify-write sequence.
          However, if another update took place during your read-modify-write sequence then your update will fail with an appropriate error.
          Concurrent change control is optional. It will be applied only if you include a resource version in an update request.
          When creating a new instance of a resource you must leave the resource version empty.
          Its value will be populated by the participant server upon successful resource creation.
          Optional
        annotations: |-
          A set of modifiable key-value pairs that can be used to represent arbitrary, client-specific metadata.
          Constraints:

          1. The total size over all keys and values cannot exceed 256kb in UTF-8 encoding.
          2. Keys are composed of an optional prefix segment and a required name segment such that:

             - key prefix, when present, must be a valid DNS subdomain with at most 253 characters, followed by a '/' (forward slash) character,
             - name segment must have at most 63 characters that are either alphanumeric ([a-z0-9A-Z]), or a '.' (dot), '-' (dash) or '_' (underscore);
               and it must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

          3. Values can be any non-empty strings.

          Keys with empty prefix are reserved for end-users.
          Properties set by external tools or internally by the participant server must use non-empty key prefixes.
          Duplicate keys are disallowed by the semantics of the protobuf3 maps.
          See: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#maps
          Annotations may be a part of a modifiable resource.
          Use the resource's update RPC to update its annotations.
          In order to add a new annotation or update an existing one using an update RPC, provide the desired annotation in the update request.
          In order to remove an annotation using an update RPC, provide the target annotation's key but set its value to the empty string in the update request.

          Fetches the contract keys into the caches to speed up the command processing.
          Should only contain contract keys that are expected to be resolved during interpretation of the commands.
          Keys of disclosed contracts do not need prefetching.

          Optional
        commands: |-
          Individual elements of this atomic command. Must be non-empty.
          Required
        read_as: |-
          Set of parties on whose behalf (in addition to all parties listed in ``act_as``) contracts can be retrieved.
          This affects Daml operations such as ``fetch``, ``fetchByKey``, ``lookupByKey``, ``exercise``, and ``exerciseByKey``.
          Note: A command can only use contracts that are visible to at least
          one of the parties in ``act_as`` or ``read_as``. This visibility check is independent from the Daml authorization
          rules for fetch operations.
          If ledger API authorization is enabled, then the authorization metadata must authorize the sender of the request
          to read contract data on behalf of each of the given parties.
          Optional
        act_as: |-
          Set of parties on whose behalf the command should be executed, if submitted.
          If ledger API authorization is enabled, then the authorization metadata must authorize the sender of the request
          to **read** (not act) on behalf of each of the given parties. This is because this RPC merely prepares a transaction
          and does not execute it. Therefore read authorization is sufficient even for actAs parties.
          Note: This may change, and more specific authorization scope may be introduced in the future.
          Each element must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required, must be non-empty.
        min_ledger_time: Optional
        user_id: |-
          Uniquely identifies the participant user that prepares the transaction.
          Must be a valid UserIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required unless authentication is used with a user token.
          In that case, the token's user-id will be used for the request's user_id.

          Prune all immediately and retroactively divulged contracts created before `prune_up_to`
          independent of whether they were archived before `prune_up_to`. Useful to avoid leaking
          storage on participant nodes that can see a divulged contract but not its archival.

          Application developers SHOULD write their Daml applications
          such that they do not rely on divulged contracts; i.e., no warnings from
          using divulged contracts as inputs to transactions are emitted.

          Participant node operators SHOULD set the `prune_all_divulged_contracts` flag to avoid leaking
          storage due to accumulating unarchived divulged contracts PROVIDED that:

          1. no application using this participant node relies on divulgence OR
          2. divulged contracts on which applications rely have been re-divulged after the `prune_up_to` offset.

          Each key must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          The interpretation of the filter depends on the transaction-shape being filtered:

          1. For **transaction trees** (used in GetUpdateTreesResponse for backwards compatibility) all party keys used as
             wildcard filters, and all subtrees whose root has one of the listed parties as an informee are returned.
             If there are ``CumulativeFilter``s, those will control returned ``CreatedEvent`` fields where applicable, but will
             not be used for template/interface filtering.
          2. For **ledger-effects** create and exercise events are returned, for which the witnesses include at least one of
             the listed parties and match the per-party filter.
          3. For **transaction and active-contract-set streams** create and archive events are returned for all contracts whose
             stakeholders include at least one of the listed parties and match the per-party filter.

          Required
        filters_for_any_party: |-

          An update path can also point to non-``Modifiable`` fields such as 'is_local'
          as long as the values provided in the update request match the server values.

          For a contract there could be multiple contract_entry-s in the entire snapshot. These together define

          A contract_entry is included in the result, if and only if there is at least one stakeholder party of the contract
          that is hosted on the synchronizer at the time of the event and the party satisfies the

        fieldComments:
          active_contract: |-
            The contract is active on the assigned synchronizer, meaning: there was an activation event on the given synchronizer (
            created, assigned), which is not followed by a deactivation event (archived, unassigned) on the same
            synchronizer, until the active_at_offset.
            Since activeness is defined as a per synchronizer concept, it is possible, that a contract is active on one
            synchronizer, but already archived on another.
            There will be one such message for each synchronizer the contract is active on.

            Lower bound for the ledger time assigned to the resulting transaction.
            The ledger time of a transaction is assigned as part of command interpretation.
            Important note: for interactive submissions, if the transaction depends on time, it **must** be signed
            and submitted within a time window around the ledger time assigned to the transaction during the prepare method.
            The time delta around that ledger time is a configuration of the ledger, usually short, around 1 minute.
            If however the transaction does not depend on time, the available time window to sign and submit the transaction is bound
            by the submission timestamp, which is also assigned in the "prepare" step (this request),
            but can be configured with a much larger skew, allowing for more time to sign the request (in the order of hours).
            Must not be set at the same time as min_ledger_time_rel.
