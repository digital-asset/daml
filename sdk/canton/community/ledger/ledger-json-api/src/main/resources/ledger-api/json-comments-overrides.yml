        Used both for filtering create and archive events as well as for filtering transaction trees.
      fieldComments:
        filtersByParty: |-
          Each key must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          The interpretation of the filter depends on the transaction-shape being filtered:

          1. For **transaction trees** (used in GetUpdateTreesResponse for backwards compatibility) all party keys used as
             wildcard filters, and all subtrees whose root has one of the listed parties as an informee are returned.
             If there are ``CumulativeFilter``s, those will control returned ``CreatedEvent`` fields where applicable, but will
             not be used for template/interface filtering.
          2. For **ledger-effects** create and exercise events are returned, for which the witnesses include at least one of
             the listed parties and match the per-party filter.
          3. For **transaction and active-contract-set streams** create and archive events are returned for all contracts whose
             stakeholders include at least one of the listed parties and match the per-party filter.
        filtersForAnyParty: |-
          Wildcard filters that apply to all the parties existing on the participant. The interpretation of the filters is the same
          with the per-party filter as described above.

        Provided for backwards compatibility, it will be removed in the Canton version 3.5.0.
        Complete view of an on-ledger transaction.
      fieldComments:
        updateId: |-
          Assigned by the server. Useful for correlating logs.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Required
        commandId: |-
          The ID of the command which resulted in this transaction. Missing for everyone except the submitting party.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Optional
        workflowId: |-
          The workflow ID used in command submission. Only set if the ``workflow_id`` for the command was set.
          Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).
          Optional
        effectiveAt: |-
          Ledger effective time.
          Required
        offset: |-
          The absolute offset. The details of this field are described in ``community/ledger-api/README.md``.
          Required, it is a valid absolute offset (positive integer).
        eventsById: |-
          Changes to the ledger that were caused by this transaction. Nodes of the transaction tree.
          Each key must be a valid node ID (non-negative integer).
          Required
        synchronizerId: |-
          A valid synchronizer id.
          Identifies the synchronizer that synchronized the transaction.
          Required
        traceContext: |-
          Optional; ledger API trace context

          The trace context transported in this message corresponds to the trace context supplied
          by the client application in a HTTP2 header of the original command submission.
          We typically use a header to transfer this type of information. Here we use message
          body, because it is used in gRPC streams which do not support per message headers.
          This field will be populated with the trace context contained in the original submission.
          If that was not provided, a unique ledger-api-server generated trace context will be used
          instead.
        recordTime: |-
          The time at which the transaction was recorded. The record time refers to the synchronizer
          which synchronized the transaction.
          Required

        Each tree event message type below contains a ``witness_parties`` field which
        indicates the subset of the requested parties that can see the event
        in question.

        Note that transaction trees might contain events with
        _no_ witness parties, which were included simply because they were
        children of events which have witnesses.
