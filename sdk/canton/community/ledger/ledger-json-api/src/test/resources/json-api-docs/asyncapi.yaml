            We typically use a header to transfer this type of information. Here we use message

            This field will be populated with the trace context contained in the original submission.

            instead.

               wildcard filters, and all subtrees whose root has one of the listed parties as an informee are returned.

               not be used for template/interface filtering.
            2. For **ledger-effects** create and exercise events are returned, for which the witnesses include at least one of
               the listed parties and match the per-party filter.
            3. For **transaction and active-contract-set streams** create and archive events are returned for all contracts whose
               stakeholders include at least one of the listed parties and match the per-party filter.

            The parties that are notified of this event. When a ``CreatedEvent``

            the parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter`` that are informees
            of the event. If served as part of a ACS delta transaction those will
            be limited to all parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter`` that
            are stakeholders of the contract (i.e. either signatories or observers).
            If the ``CreatedEvent`` is returned as part of an AssignedEvent,
            ActiveContract or IncompleteUnassigned (so the event is related to
            an assignment or unassignment): this will include all parties of the
            ``TransactionFilter`` that are stakeholders of the contract.

            The behavior of reading create events visible to parties not hosted
            on the participant node serving the Ledger API is undefined. Concretely,
            there is neither a guarantee that the participant node will serve all their
            create events on the ACS stream, nor is there a guarantee that matching archive
            events are delivered for such create events.

            For most clients this is not a problem, as they only read events for parties
            that are hosted on the participant node. If you need to read events
            for parties that may not be hosted at all times on the participant node,
            subscribe to the ``TopologyEvent``s for that party by setting a corresponding
            ``UpdateFormat``.  Using these events, query the ACS as-of an offset where the
            party is hosted on the participant node, and ignore create events at offsets
            where the party is not hosted on the participant node.
