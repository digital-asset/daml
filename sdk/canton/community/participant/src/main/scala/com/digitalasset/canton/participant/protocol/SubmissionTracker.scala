/** Tracker for submission, backed by a `SubmissionTrackerStore`.
  *
  * The purpose of this tracker is to detect replayed requests, and allow the participant to emit
  * a command completion only for genuine requests that it has submitted.
  *
  * A request R1 is considered fresh iff
  * it has the minimal requestId among all requests that have the same root hash,
  * for which SubmissionData has been provided.
  * In particular, for a given root hash there is at most one fresh request.
  *
  * The ScalaDocs of the individual methods prescribe when to call the methods.
  * Calling the methods in a different order will result in undefined behavior.
  * Failure to call either `cancelRegistration()` or `provideSubmissionData()` after calling `register()` for a request
  * may result in a deadlock.

  // The incoming requests are stored in a map keyed by root hash and request ID when registered, so their associated
  // data can be retrieved in the later calls.
  //
  // The main replay detection relies on a store that keeps track of which request ID was actually associated to a
  // given root hash. When replays (or at least requests sharing the same root hash) come concurrently (that is, there
  // is more than one between phases 3 and 7), the situation becomes more complicated. The following describes the
  // mechanism to handle them.
  //
  // Requests that have the same root hash (potential replays) are linked together in a list following registration
  // order. This order represents the priority for each request sharing the same root hash to become the "real" request
  // that can effect the emission of a command completion.
  //
  // When a request is cancelled, it gives the opportunity to other requests registered later but sharing the same root
  // hash to be selected.
  //
  // When a request is provided with its submission data, and it is the "first in line" (that is either the first in the
  // linked list, or all the previous ones have been cancelled), the actual replay evaluation takes place for this
  // request. The slot is effectively taken, and all other requests registered later (for the same root hash) will be
  // denied the opportunity to be selected, whether they are cancelled or provided submission data.
  //
  // In other words: given a list of requests for a given root hash, ordered by sequencing time, only the first of these
  // which has not been cancelled will be evaluated and possibly result in the emission of a command completion.
  //
  // Behavior in relation to crash recovery:
  //
  //  * Crash recovery does not clean up the submission tracker store. Therefore, if a request with ID `ts` was marked
  //    as a fresh submission, it will be in the tracker store even if it is being reprocessed after crash recovery.
  //    The idempotence of the store ensures that the resulting `requestIsValidFUS` nevertheless returns `true`.
  //
  //  * Suppose that, after a crash, the store may contain a request with a later request ID than the current request
  //    (for the same root hash). This contradicts our deterministic reprocessing assumption: if the current request
  //    attempts to be entered into the store in the current crash epoch, then it also would have attempted to do so
  //    in the previous crash epoch and therefore the later request would not have gotten in.
  //
  //  * Repair requests do not modify request IDs or root hashes, only request counters. Therefore they cannot interfere
  //    with this logic here.
