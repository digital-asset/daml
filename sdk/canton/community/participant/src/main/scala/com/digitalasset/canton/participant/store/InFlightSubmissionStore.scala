    * request until the earlier request updates the row. This is fine because the stale information will only be

    * corresponding completion event has been published by the [[com.digitalasset.canton.participant.event.RecordOrderPublisher]].

    * [[com.digitalasset.canton.participant.protocol.Phase37Synchronizer]] and either a
    * [[com.digitalasset.canton.protocol.messages.ConfirmationResultMessage]] has been processed or the decision time has elapsed.
    * By this time, the row with the stale data has been overwritten by the earlier request.
    *
    * Calls to this method also race with calls to [[observeSequencing]] for later messages, e.g., if a submission
    * request gets preplayed without a message ID. The argument about the stale data being benign also applies to
    * those races. There are no races between several calls to [[observeSequencing]] because [[observeSequencing]]
    * is called sequentially for each batch of sequenced events.
