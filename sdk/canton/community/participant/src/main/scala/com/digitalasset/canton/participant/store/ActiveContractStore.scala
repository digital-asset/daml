/** <p>The active contract store (ACS) stores for every contract ID
  * whether it is inexistent, [[ActiveContractStore.Active]],
  * [[ActiveContractStore.Archived]], or [[ActiveContractStore.TransferredAway]],
  * along with the timestamp of the latest change.
  * Every change is associated with the timestamp and request counter of the request that triggered the change.
  * The changes are ordered first by timestamp, then by request counter, and finally by change type (activations before deactivations).
  * Implementations must be thread-safe.
  * Updates must be idempotent.</p>
  *
  * <p>Creations, transfers, and archivals can be mixed arbitrarily.
  * A contract may be transferred-in and -out several times during its lifetime.
  * It becomes active with every transfer-in and transferred away with every transfer-out.
  * If the ACS detects irregularities, the change method reports them.</p>
  *
  * <p>These methods are supposed to be called by the `ConflictDetector` only,
  * which coordinates the request journal updates and the updates to the ACS.</p>
  *
  * <p>Updates may be written asynchronously.
  * Every implementation determines an order over all the changes and queries to the ACS.
  * Each individual change must be applied atomically and the result is determined with respect to this order.
  * This order need not be consistent with the order of the calls, though.
  * However, the following is guaranteed:
  * If the future returned by a call completes and observing the completion happens before another call,
  * then all changes of the former call must be ordered before all changes of the later call.</p>
  *
  * <p>Bulk methods like [[ActiveContractStore.markContractsCreated]] and [[ActiveContractStore.archiveContracts]]
  * generate one individual change for each contract.
  * So their changes may be interleaved with other calls.</p>
