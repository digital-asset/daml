/** The request tracker handles all the tasks around conflict detection that are difficult to parallelize.
  * In detail, it tracks in-flight requests, performs activeness checks, detects conflicts between requests,
  * keeps track of the sequencer time, checks for timeouts, and orchestrates the updates to the
  * [[com.digitalasset.canton.participant.store.ActiveContractStore]].
  * It does not write to the [[com.digitalasset.canton.participant.protocol.RequestJournal]], though.
  * The request tracker lives entirely in memory on a single compute node.
  *
  * The request tracker is a deterministic component that depends only on the ACS state and the sequencer messages.
  * The order and timing in which the request tracker receives this information does not matter.
  * (Even more broadly, the participant has no functional notion of “wall-clock” time;
  * all time and timestamps come from sequencer messages.)
  * These properties of determinism and sequencer time are both important parts of Canton
  * and critical to the crash recovery model.
  *
  * To keep track of the sequencer time, the request tracker must be notified
  * of every message that is received from the sequencer.
  * These notifications need not happen in order, but they must happen eventually. Every such message has
  * an associated monotonically increasing [[SequencerCounter]]. If one of the sequencer counters is skipped,
  * the request tracker may stall indefinitely. Every message has an associated timestamp. Time must
  * increase with every message in the order given by the sequencer counter.
  * This means that for sequencer counters `sc1` and `sc2` with `sc1` &lt; `sc2`, the associated timestamps `ts1` and `ts2`
  * must satisfy `ts1` &lt; `ts2`.
  *
  * Requests are identified by [[RequestCounter]]s, which themselves must be a monotonically increasing sequence without
  * gaps.
  *
  * The request tracker uses these time signals to determine on which requests a verdict can be issued,
  * which requests have timed out, and which requests and contract states can be safely evicted
  * from the tracker's internal state. We say that the request tracker has <strong>observed</strong> a timestamp
  * if it has been signalled this timestamp or a later one. The request tracker can <strong>progress
  * to</strong> a timestamp `ts` if it has observed all timestamps up to and including `ts`
  * and all commit sets with commit times up to `ts` have been added with [[RequestTracker.addCommitSet]].
  *
  * If the request tracker can progress to a timestamp `ts`, then it must eventually complete all futures
  * that [[RequestTracker.addRequest]] and [[RequestTracker.addCommitSet]] have returned
  * and that are associated with a timestamp equal or prior to `ts`.
  * The futures are associated to the following timestamps:
  * <ul>
  *   <li>Activeness result: the activeness time of the request, typically the timestamp on the request</li>
  *   <li>Timeout result: the decision time of the request</li>
  *   <li>Finalization result: the commit time of the request</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * The three methods [[RequestTracker.addRequest]], [[RequestTracker.addResult]],
  * and [[RequestTracker.addCommitSet]] must normally be called in the given sequence;
  * the latter two need not be called if the request has timed out.
  * A request is <strong>in-flight</strong> from the corresponding call to [[RequestTracker.addRequest]]
  * until the request tracker has progressed to its decision time (if the request times out) or its commit time.
  *
  * These three methods are idempotent while the request is in-flight. That is, if one of the methods is called twice
  * with the same arguments, provided that the first one succeeded, then the second call has no effect,
  * but its return value is equivalent to what the first call returned.
  * If the method is called twice for the same request counter with different arguments, the subsequent behavior
  * of the request tracker becomes unspecified.
  * The same applies if the same sequencer counter is supplied several times with different timestamps.
  *
  * A request tracker is typically initialized with a [[SequencerCounter]] and a [[com.digitalasset.canton.data.CantonTimestamp]],
  * causing it to be ready to handle requests starting from the given sequencer counter (inclusive) and timestamp
  * (exclusive).
  *
  * =Conflict detection=
  * The request tracker checks whether a request uses only contracts that are active
  * at the activeness timestamp of the request.
  * To that end, it determines the [[ActivenessResult]] of the request.
  * A non-conflicting request should be approved in a response by the participant.
  * A conflicting request should be rejected.
  *
  * To describe conflict behavior, we introduce a few concepts:
  *
  * A <strong>conflict detection time</strong> is a triple ([[com.digitalasset.canton.data.CantonTimestamp]], `Kind`, [[SequencerCounter]]).
  * There are three kinds, and they are ordered by
  * {{{Finalization < Timeout < Activeness}}}.
  * Conflict detection times are ordered lexicographically.
  * In other words, {{{(ts1, kind1, sc1) < (ts2, kind2, sc2)}}} if and only if
  * {{{ts1 < ts2}}} or {{{ts1 == ts2 && kind1 < kind2}}} or {{{ts1 == ts2 && kind1 == kind2 && sc1 < sc2.}}}
  *
  * A request with [[SequencerCounter]] `sc` and [[com.digitalasset.canton.data.CantonTimestamp]] `ts` induces two conflict detection times:
  * The <strong>sequencing time</strong> at `(ts, Activeness, sc)` and the <strong>timeout time</strong> at
  * (decisionTime, Timeout, sc) where `decisionTime` is the decision time of the request.
  * Without logical reordering, the sequencing time is also the request's activeness time.
  * (Technically, the activeness time must lie between the sequencing time and the decision time;
  * see [[RequestTracker.addRequest]].)
  * A result with [[SequencerCounter]] `sc` and [[com.digitalasset.canton.data.CantonTimestamp]] `ts` also defines two conflict detection times:
  * The <strong>verdict time</strong> `(ts, Result, sc)` and the <strong>finalization time</strong>
  * `(commitTime, Finalize, sc)` where `commitTime` is the commit time of the request.
  *
  * A request is <strong>active</strong> at some conflict detection time `t` if all of the following holds:
  * <ul>
  *   <li>Its sequencing time is equal or prior to `t`.</li>
  *   <li>If no finalization time is known for the request, then `t` is equal or prior to the request's timeout time.</li>
  *   <li>If a finalization time is known for the request, then `t` is equal or prior to the finalization time.</li>
  * </ul>
  * The finalization time of a request is known if the result has been successfully signalled
  * to the request tracker using [[RequestTracker.addResult]].
  *
  * A request is <strong>finalized</strong> at some conflict detection time `t`
  * if its finalization time is known and equal or prior to `t`.
  *
  * A contract is <strong>active</strong> at time `t` if a request with activeness time at most `t` activates it, and
  * there is no finalized request at time `t` that has deactivated it.
  * Activation happens through creation and assignment.
  * Deactivation happens through archival and unassignment.
  * An active contract `c` is locked at time `t` if one of the following cases holds:
  * <ul>
  *   <li>There is an active request at time `t` that activates `c`.
  *     In that case, we say that the contract is in activation.</li>
  *   <li>There is an active request at time `t` that deactivates `c` and the request does not activate `c`.</li>
  * </ul>
  * A contract may be locked because of activation and deactivation at the same time if there are two active requests,
  * one activating the contract and another deactivating it.
  * For example, if one request `r1`
  * creates a contract with sequencing time `t1` and finalization time `t1'` and another request `r2`
  * with sequencing time `t2` between `t1` and `t1'` archives it (despite that `r2`'s activeness check fails),
  * then the contract is created at time `t1` and archived at `t2`.
  *
  * Activeness of contracts is checked at the request's activeness time.
  * The [[ActivenessResult]] lists all contracts from the [[ActivenessSet]] of the request that are either locked or whose precondition fails.
  * The activeness check succeeds if the activeness result is empty.
