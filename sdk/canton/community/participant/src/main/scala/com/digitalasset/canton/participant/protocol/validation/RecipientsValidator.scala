  /** Checks the recipients of all inputs and discards inputs corresponding to views with invalid recipients.
    * Also reports a security alert on invalid recipients.
    *
    * Effectively, the method tries to establish consensus on whether the recipients of an input are valid, and
    * if consensus cannot be established, then the input is discarded.
    * So an input may even be discarded, if its recipients are valid (but not every recipient knows about this).
    *
    * A view v will be kept iff there is a path rp through the recipients tree (ordered leaf to root)
    * such that the following conditions hold:
    * 1. Every informee of the view is hosted by an active participant.
    * 2. Every informee participant of the view v is declared as a recipient of v in the first element of rp.
    * 3. For every descendant v2 of v and every informee participant p of v, the participant p is declared as recipient of v2.
    *    Thereby, if v2 and v have distance d, then participant p needs to be declared at element d+1 in rp.
    * 4. Every descendant of v also meets Conditions 1-3 with the same path rp.
    *
    * Why does this give us transparency?
    * If an informee participant p1 keeps a view v, then:
    * - Every informee of the view v is hosted by an active participant.
    * - Every informee participant of v has received v.
    * - Every informee participant of v has received every descendant of v.
    * - Every informee participant of v can evaluate the above conditions 1-4 for v and will conclude that v should be kept.
    *
    * As for all other validations, the recipients validation is performed using the topology effective at the sequencing time
    * of the request. The submitter, however, creates the request using the latest topology available locally. Therefore, it is
    * possible that a change in topology between submission and sequencing time results in errors detected by the
    * recipients validator: for example, a party can be newly or no longer hosted on a participant, thereby affecting
    * the recipients.
    * These situations are quite common on a busy network with concurrent changes, and logging them at a high severity
    * is overkill and possibly confusing. Therefore, if the errors detected can possibly be attributed to a change in the
    * topology, we perform the check again using the topology at submission time. If no error occurs then, the original
    * errors are logged at a lower severity.
    * Note that the *outcome* of the validation is itself not affected: in other words, the request will still be rejected.
    * The only change is the severity of the logs.
    *
    * @return errors for the incorrect recipients and inputs with valid recipients
    * @throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the views corresponding to inputs have different root hashes
