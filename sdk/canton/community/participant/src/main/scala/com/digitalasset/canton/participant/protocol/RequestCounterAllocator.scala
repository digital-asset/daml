    *
    * All calls must be sequential with increasing sequencer counters, although they can run in different threads.

    * then returning from the call for `sc1` must happen before the call for `sc2`.
    *
    * Consecutive calls are idempotent. So if [[allocateFor]] is called for the same sequencer counter twice,
    * without another intervening call for a difference sequencer counter,
    * then the second call returns the same result as the first one.

    *                                         because an earlier call assigned already a
