// Allows clients to read updates (transactions, (un)assignments, topology events) from the ledger.
//
// ``GetUpdates`` and ``GetUpdateTrees`` provide a comprehensive stream of updates/changes
// which happened on the virtual shared ledger. These streams are indexed with ledger
// offsets, which are strictly increasing.
// The virtual shared ledger consist of changes happening on multiple synchronizers which are
// connected to the serving participant. Each update belongs to one synchronizer, this is
// provided in the result (the ``synchronizer_id`` field in ``Transaction`` and ``TransactionTree``
// for transactions, the ``source`` field in ``UnassignedEvent`` and the ``target`` field in ``AssignedEvent``).
// Consumers can rely on strong causal guarantees on the virtual shared ledger for a single
// synchronizer: updates which have greater offsets are happened after than updates with smaller
// offsets for the same synchronizer. Across different synchronizers this is not guaranteed.
