// in order to connect to a remote Canton synchronizer.
//
// The connect call is just a wrapper that invokes the `synchronizers.register`, `synchronizers.get_agreement` and `synchronizers.accept_agreement` calls.
//
// The address can be either HTTP or HTTPS. From a security perspective, we do assume that we either trust TLS to
// initially introduce the synchronizer. If we don't trust TLS for that, we can also optionally include a so called
// EssentialState that establishes the trust of the participant to the synchronizer.
// Whether a synchronizer will let a participant connect or not is at the discretion of the synchronizer and can be configured
// there. While Canton establishes the connection, we perform a handshake, exchanging keys, authorizing the connection
// and verifying version compatibility.

// permissionless in this example, the approval will be granted immediately.
