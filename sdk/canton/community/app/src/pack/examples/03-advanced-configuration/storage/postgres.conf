# Postgres persistence configuration mixin

# This file defines a shared configuration resources. You can mix it into your configuration by
# refer to the shared storage resource and add the database name.
#
# Example:
#   participant1 {
#     storage = ${_shared.storage}
#     storage.config.properties.databaseName = "participant1"
#   }
#
# The user and password credentials are set to "canton" and "supersafe". As this is not "supersafe", you might
# want to either change this configuration file or pass the settings in via environment variables.
