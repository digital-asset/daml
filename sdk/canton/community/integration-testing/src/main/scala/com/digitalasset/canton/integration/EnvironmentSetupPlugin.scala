/** Plugin to allow multiple tests to reuse behavior modifying the test config or environment without having to modify
  * the test definition.
  * For instance running tests against Postgres vs the default config, with the plugin being able to provide or verify
  * the backend database exists.
  * Will work regardless of whether the test is using [[IsolatedEnvironments]] or [[SharedEnvironment]] integration
  * test setups.
  * Must call [[EnvironmentSetup.registerPlugin]] within its constructor to register the plugin.
