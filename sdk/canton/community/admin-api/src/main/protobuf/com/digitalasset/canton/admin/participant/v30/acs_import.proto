package com.digitalasset.canton.admin.participant.v30;

// Defines override mappings for assigning representative package IDs to contracts upon ACS import.
//
// The representative package ID is assigned to a contract upon ACS import based on the following precedence rules.
//  1. The associated override for the contract ID in RepresentativePackageIdOverride.contract_override, if specified and present in the package store
//  2. The associated override for the contract's original package ID in RepresentativePackageIdOverride.package_id_override, if specified and present in the package store
//  3. The contract's representative package ID from the ACS snapshot, if present in the package store
//  4. The contract's creation package ID, if present in the package store
//  5. The associated override for the contract's package name in RepresentativePackageIdOverride.package_name_override, if specified and present in the package store
//  6. The highest-versioned package in the participant's package store for the contract's package name
//
// If none of the above rules yield a representative package ID, the ACS import request will fail.
//
// See ``CreatedEvent.representative_package_id`` in ``event.proto`` for more details on the concept of
// representative package IDs.
