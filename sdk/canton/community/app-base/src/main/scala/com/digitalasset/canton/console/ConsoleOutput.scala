    * - If there is an error, then report this to the log file. The log file will also be displayed to the user.
    * - If a command completes successfully, do not output anything.
    * - If a command returns some `value`, then make the command return the value (instead of printing the value to the console).
    *   This allows the user to access the value programmatically.
