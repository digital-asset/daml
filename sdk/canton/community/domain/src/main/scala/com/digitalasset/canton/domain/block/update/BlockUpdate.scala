  * @param invalidAcknowledgements All invalid acknowledgement timestamps in the block for each member.
  * @param events New sequenced events for members, and the snapshot to be used for signing them.
  * @param inFlightAggregationUpdates The updates to the in-flight aggregation states.
  *                             Includes the clean-up of expired aggregations.
  * @param lastSequencerEventTimestamp The highest timestamp of an event in `events` addressed to the sequencer, if any.

  * @param submissionsOutcomes  A list of internal block sequencer states after processing submissions for the chunk.
