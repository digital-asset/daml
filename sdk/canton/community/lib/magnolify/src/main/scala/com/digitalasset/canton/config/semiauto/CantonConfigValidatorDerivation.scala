    * from a [[CantonConfigPrevalidator]] instance (found by implicit resolution) for the configuration `A`
    * and all its subconfigurations unless implicit resolution already finds a [[CantonConfigValidator]] instance for them.
    * Implicit resolution must also find [[CantonConfigPrevalidator]] instances for all subconfigurations of `A`
    * for which derivation happens.
    *
    * [[manual.CantonConfigValidatorDerivation]] should be preferred when possible
    * because it is more predictable and usually more efficient. In particular,
    * derivation failures can be hard to debug for semi-automatic derivation.
    * For example, suppose that `A` is a case class `Foo` with a field `i: Option[Bar]`
    * where implicit resolution does not find a [[CantonConfigValidator]] instance for `Bar`.
    * The derivation sees that `Option` is a sealed trait of case classes `None` and `Some`
    * and therefore attempts to derive a [[CantonConfigValidator]] instance for `None` and `Some`.
    * The derivation for `None` will fail though because there is no [[CantonConfigPrevalidator]]
    * instance for `None`. This makes the overall derivation fail with a rather obscure error message
    * about implicit resolution problems.
