/** When a `synchronized` block returns a [[scala.concurrent.Future]], then the synchronization typically
  * does not extend to the computations performed inside the future.
  * This often hides a concurrency bug that is hard to spot during review
  * because the computation's code is lexically inside the synchronized block
  * and it may not be obvious that [[scala.concurrent.Future]]s are in play.
  *
  * For example, `synchronized` blocks are often used to read and update the state of an object
  * atomically. When the update operation involves a [[scala.concurrent.Future]] like below,
  * then the write to the state is actually not guarded by the synchronized call and the update is not atomic.
  *
  * <pre>
  *   synchronized {
  *     val x = this.atomicRef.get()
  *     futureComputation(x).map { y =>
  *       this.atomicRef.set(y)
  *       y
  *     }
  *   }
  * </pre>
  *
  * The proper approach in the above example is to use a semaphore instead of a `synchronized` block.
  *
  * <pre>
  *   blocking { this.semaphore.acquire() }
  *   val x = this.atomicRef.get()
  *   futureComputation(x).map { y =>
  *     this.atomicRef.set(y)
  *     y
  *   }.thereafter { _ => this.semaphore.release() }
  * </pre>
  *
  * If the synchronization intentionally does not have to extend over the [[scala.concurrent.Future]] computation,
  * it usually helps with readability to move the future out of the synchronized block. For example,
  *
  * <pre>
  *   blocking(synchronized {
  *     val x = criticalSection()
  *     Future { nonCriticalSection(x) }
  *   })
  * </pre>
  *
  * should be written as follows:
  *
  * <pre>
  *   val x = blocking(synchronized { criticalSection() })
  *   Future { nonCriticalSection(x) }
  * </pre>
  *
  * There are cases where the `synchronized` block is supposed to return a [[scala.concurrent.Future]],
  * for example when dealing with the promise of a future. In such a case, the warning should simply be suppressed locally.
