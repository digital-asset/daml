Haskell Proto Source for the Ledger API
=======================================

This module provides a Haskell compilation of the ledger-api proto files, frozen as of 2025-07-18.  
Haskell bindings to the ledger API are deprecated, and it is assumed that the ledger API will not introduce breaking changes for the package service, party management, and user management.

**Important:** Do not use the proto definitions contained in this module for any other purpose.
