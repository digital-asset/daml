Base library for DA Haskell code
=================================

The libraries provided by Hackage adapted to the needs of DA.

The intention of this version of this library published as part of Simon
Meier's HaskellerZ talk on 2016-01-27 is that it serves as an inspirational
source for how to adapt Hackage to a company's needs. DA currently does not
plan to provide an officially supported version of this library. However, we
very much encourage people to take and reshape this code into a library that
allows to share this kind of Hackage-adaption-code.
