# The standard library

The Daml standard library is a collection of Daml modules that can be used to implement concrete applications.

## Usage

The standard library is included in the Daml compiler so it can
be used straight out of the box. You can import modules from the standard library just like your own, for example:

```
import DA.Optional
import DA.Time
```
