-- @ERROR range=27:7-27:31; Possible Daml-specific reason for the following type error: Tried to implement method ‘getValueNonexistent’, but interface ‘I’ (Type synonym of ‘MyLongInterfaceNameI’) does not have a method with that name. Method ‘getValueNonexistent’ is only a method on the following interfaces: ‘J’

type I = MyLongInterfaceNameI
interface MyLongInterfaceNameI where
  getValueGood : Int
  getValueBad : Int
  viewtype TView

interface J where
  getValueNonexistent : ()

data TView = TView {}

    signatory p
    interface instance I for T where
      view = TView
      -- Check that method return types matching resolves synonyms first
      getValueGood = 1 -- matching case
      -- Check that missing method warnings still considers I to be an interface
      getValueNonexistent = ()
