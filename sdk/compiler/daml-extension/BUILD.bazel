#
# Because `vsce` needs to run in a folder where all of the node_modules
# dependencies are already populated, this separate step takes all of the
# node_module files, one by one (because that is how Bazel exposes them),
# copies them to their intended place, and then bundles the whole node_modules
# folder as a tarball so the next task, below, can depend on that cached
# tarball and be fast.
# Also for some reason on Windows I get "cannot ceate node_modules: file
# exists", so at this point I'm completely out of trust.
