// Ad-hoc data structure backed by an array to implement speedy stacks.
// This implementation is tailored specifically for this use case and is not intended to be a general-purpose stack.
// Key characteristics:
//  - No bounds checking is performed.
//  - It is 1-indexed, meaning the top of the stack is at index 1.
//  - The `push` method assumes the stack is not full; growing the stack when needed is the caller's responsibility.
//  - Includes a `keep` operation to retain the oldest `n` elements of the stack while discarding the rest.
//
// We force `X` to be an AnyRef to avoid the need a ClassTag.
