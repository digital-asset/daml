This script is meant to help with managing releases. Usage:

$0 snapshot SHA PREFIX
        Prints the snapshot line for commit SHA as a release candidate for
        version PREFIX. For example:

        $ $0 snapshot cc880e2 0.1.2
        cc880e290b2311d0bf05d58c7d75c50784c0131c 0.1.2-snapshot.20200513.4174.0.cc880e29 SPLIT_RELEASE

        Any non-ambiguous git commit reference can be given as SHA.

$0 check
        Checks that each line of the LATEST file is well-formed.

Any other invocation will display this help message.

For further details, see the documentation in /release/RELEASE.md
