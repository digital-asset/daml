# Daml Finance - Lifecycling Tutorials

This project contains the source code used in the Daml Finance lifecycling tutorials.

Before opening Visual Studio Code you should run `./get-dependencies.sh` (or `get-dependencies.bat`
for Windows users) to download the required Daml packages.

You can then open Daml Studio by running `daml studio`, or build the project using `daml build`.

To run the project, run `daml start` (which also builds the project).
