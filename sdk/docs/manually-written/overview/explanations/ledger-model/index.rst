Canton enables multi-party workflows by providing parties with a *virtual global ledger* (VGL),
which encodes the current state of their shared contracts written in a smart contract language.
At a high level, the interactions are visualized below:
Three parties Alice, Bob, and Charlie connect independently to a virtual global ledger, depicted as a large cloud.
They hold different views of that ledger in their local databases shown as blue icons.
The global ledger is virtual in the sense that no single entity typically sees this global ledger in its entirety;
it is an imaginary database that represents the union of all parties' databases.

The Ledger Model defines:

  #. What the ledger looks like - the structure of the Canton Ledger
  #. Who can request which changes - the integrity model for the Canton Ledger
  #. Who sees which changes and data - the privacy model for the Canton Ledger

The sections below review these concepts of the Ledger Model in turn and how they relate to Daml smart contracts.

Running example
***************

The running example for the Ledger Model is a simple multi-party interaction of two parties atomically swapping their digital assets.
A digital asset is modeled as a ``SimpleAsset`` with an issuer, an owner, and the asset description.
The owner can transfer such an asset to a new owner with the ``Transfer`` choice.

.. note::
   These Daml templates are for illustration purposes only.
   They are not meant for real-world usage as they are heavily simplified.

.. literalinclude:: ./daml/SimpleAsset.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: SNIPPET-START
   :end-before: SNIPPET-END

An atomic swap, also known as delivery versus payment (DvP), combines two asset transfers between the parties in a single transaction.
The ``SimpleDvP`` template below captures the agreement between two parties ``partyA`` and ``partyB`` to swap ownership of the two allocated assets.
Either party to the DvP can execute the swap by exercising the ``Settle`` choice.

.. literalinclude:: ./daml/SimpleDvP.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: SNIPPET-DVP-BEGIN
   :end-before: SNIPPET-DVP-END

To create a DvP contract instance, the parties go through the usual propose-accept workflow pattern shown next.
Party ``proposer`` creates a proposal for the party ``counterparty`` with their allocated asset and the description of the asset they expect to swap with.
The ``counterparty`` can accept the proposal with the ``Accept`` choice to create a ``SimpleDvP`` contract or to accept and immediately settle the swap with the ``AcceptAndSettle`` choice.

.. literalinclude:: ./daml/SimpleDvP.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: SNIPPET-PROPOSAL-BEGIN
   :end-before: SNIPPET-PROPOSAL-END
