// the claims in the token are insufficient to perform a given operation.

  // is not sufficient to render it usable, it must be activated first.

  // - Succeed, if the package was successfully uploaded, or if the same package
  //   was already uploaded before.

  //   the backing participant.
  // - Respond with INVALID_ARGUMENT, if the DAR file is too big or malformed.
  // The maximum supported size is implementation specific.
