// Rules on error reporting over the Ledger API
// ********************************************
//
// 1. We use gRPC status codes to report synchronous success and failures
//    coming from the underlying gRPC protocol or the API-level request processing.
//    Asynchronous API-level errors are reported over a completion stream like the command completion stream,
//    which themselves include a `google.rpc.Status` message to indicate the status.
//    The status code `OK` denotes success.
//
// 2. Error reporting includes relevant error details in the `details` field of the status message,
//    following the gRPC rich error model as described at https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model.
//    Error details use the `google.rpc.ErrorInfo` message defined at
//    https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L112.
//    Its `reason` field includes an alphanumeric error code.
//    Further details on the error and information for subsequent API calls may be included in the `metadata` field.
//    The Ledger API RPC documentation may document further metadata of the error.
//
// 3. RPC requests can specify that the API-level error details of the RPC response shall be JSON-encoded in the error message
//    instead of using the `details` field. To that end, the RPC request shall specify the ``X-Daml-Error-Details-In-Message``
//    HTTP/2 header in the request. If an application cannot read the error details from the trailers,
//    e.g. because some middleware drops them, it can obtain the details by parsing the message.
//    This flag does not affect asynchronous errors reported as part of completions.
//
//    TODO(v2) Evaluate whether we can implement this as a gRPC interceptor that listens for the header
//     and converts the rich error details into JSON. Otherwise this might not work for
//     errors coming from the underlying gRPC protocol.
//     If this doesn't work, we can alternatively add a flag to all RPC requests.
//     For transparency, consider encoding the whole ``google.rpc.Status message`` in the message.
//
//    TODO(v2) We shoule use the same JSON encoding here as what we get from our JSON API server.
//     We want to keep the human-readable message in one of the JSON fields.
//
// 4. For now, only ``ErrorInfo`` is used to communicate error details.
//    Other forms of error details may be added in the future though.
//
//
// Common error codes and details for all services
// ***********************************************
//
// Individual services may use the error codes below for other cases too.
// See the documentation of the service for details.
//
// ``UNAUTHENTICATED``:
// - The request does not include a valid access token.
//
// ``PERMISSION_DENIED``:
// - The claims in the token are insufficient to perform a given operation.
//
// ``NOT_FOUND``:
// - The request does not include a valid ledger id.
//
// ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``:
// - The payload is malformed or is missing required fields.
//
// ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED``:
// - The participant or the ledger is overloaded. Clients should back off exponentially and retry.
//
// ``DEADLINE_EXCEEDED``:
// - The server failed to produce a result within the given timeouts.
//   For requests that change the ledger state, clients MUST assume neither
//   that the request succeeded nor that it was rejected.
//
//
// Error codes for command submissions
// ***********************************
//
// TODO(v2) Define test cases for these errors and enforce these error rules via the ledger API test tool
//
// This applies to the services in ``command_service.proto`` and ``command_submission_service.proto``.
// The common error codes from above also apply here.
// The status message in command completions as defined in ``completion.proto`` follow the same rules.
//
// Some Daml ledger implementations may produce the same error codes in further situations.
// See the documentation of the specific Daml ledger implementation.
//
// If the submission led to a completion event, the following error details are provided:
// 1. If the error is reported outside of the completion event (e.g., via the command service),
//    the metadata key ``completion_offset`` contains the corresponding completion offset.
//    This offset can be used as a submission rank in later calls.
// 2. If the completion event at the offset is a definite answer,
//    the metadata key ''definite_answer`` is set to ``true``.
//
// ``UNAVAILABLE``:
// - The participant is not yet ready to submit commands or if the service has been shut down.
//
// ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED``:
// - The number of in-flight commands reached the maximum (if a limit is configured).
//
// ``NOT_FOUND``:
// - The submission rank or deduplication period are too old.
//
// ``OUT_OF_RANGE``
// - The deduplication period starts in the future (e.g., the specified offset is higher than the completion end).
// - The submission rank is after the completion end.
//
// ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``:
// - A party involved in the transaction is not known on the ledger.
// - The interpreted command is inconsistent with the state of the ledger.
//   TODO(error cleanup)
//
// ``ABORTED``:
// - The command submission was disputed or the ledger time is invalid.
// - There is another submission in flight for the same change ID.
//   In this case, the error details report the reason ``ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT``.
//   The error details include the metadata keys ``submission_rank`` and `submission_id`` of the in-flight submission.
// - A lock for serializability checking could not be acquired during commit time, e.g., due to contention.
//   TODO(error cleanup)
//
// ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``
// - There is another submission with a higher submission rank.
//   The error details report the reason ``RANK_TOO_LOW`` and include the metadata keys ``submission_rank``
//   and ``submission_id`` of the conflicting submission.
//   If the conflicting submission has previously produced a definite-answer completion,
//   ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` is used instead.
//
// ``ALREADY_EXISTS``
// - There is a definite-answer completion for the same change ID with the same or higher submission rank
//   or an earlier accepting completion that falls into the submission’s deduplication period.
//   The error details report the reason ``DEDUPLICATION``;
//   if available, the metadata keys ``earlier_completion_offset`` and ``earlier_submission_id``
//   contain the completion offset and submission id of the conflicting completion.
//
