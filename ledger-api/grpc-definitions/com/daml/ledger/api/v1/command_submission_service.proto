// Allows clients to attempt advancing the ledger's state by submitting commands.
// The final states of their submissions are disclosed by the Command Completion Service.
// The on-ledger effects of their submissions are disclosed by the Transaction Service.
// Commands may fail in 4 distinct manners:
//
// 1) ``INVALID_PARAMETER`` gRPC error on malformed payloads and missing required fields.
// 2) Failure communicated in the gRPC error.
// 3) Failure communicated in a Completion.
// 4) A Checkpoint with ``record_time`` > command ``mrt`` arrives through the Completion Stream, and the command's Completion was not visible before. In this case the command is lost.
//
// Clients that do not receive a successful completion about their submission MUST NOT assume that it was successful.
// Clients SHOULD subscribe to the CompletionStream before starting to submit commands to prevent race conditions.
//
// Interprocess tracing of command submissions may be achieved via Zipkin by filling out the ``trace_context`` field.
// The server will return a child context of the submitted one, (or a new one if the context was missing) on both the Completion and Transaction streams.
