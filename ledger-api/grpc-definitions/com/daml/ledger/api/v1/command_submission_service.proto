  // - ``NOT_FOUND``: if the request does not include a valid ledger id or if a resource is missing (e.g. contract key)
  // due to for example contention on resources
  // - ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` if a resource is duplicated (e.g. contract key)
  // - ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``: if the payload is malformed or is missing required fields
  // - ``ABORTED``: if the number of in-flight commands reached the maximum (if a limit is configured)
  // - ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``: on consistency errors (e.g. the contract key has changed since the submission)
  // or if an interpretation error occurred
  // - ``UNAVAILABLE``: if the participant is not yet ready to submit commands or if the service has been shut down.
