This is the documentation for the Daml participant integration API.

Notable interfaces to be implemented by ledger integrations include:

  - [[com.daml.ledger.participant.state.v2.ReadService `ReadService`]] - an interface for reading data from the underlying ledger.
  - [[com.daml.ledger.participant.state.v2.WriteService `WriteService`]] - an interface for writing data to the underlying ledger.
  - [[com.daml.ledger.api.auth.AuthService `AuthService`]] - an interface for authorizing ledger API calls.

Notable classes for running a ledger participant node include:

  - [[com.daml.platform.indexer.IndexerServiceOwner `IndexerServiceOwner`]] - the indexer reads data from the
    [[com.daml.ledger.participant.state.v2.ReadService `ReadService`]] and writes it to an index database.
  - [[com.daml.platform.apiserver.LedgerApiService `LedgerApiService`]] - the API server reads data from the index
    database and Indexer (see `com.daml.platform.index.InMemoryStateUpdater`) and serves it over the gRPC ledger API.

See the complete list on the right for details.
