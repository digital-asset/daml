-- The examples for 'leftSpine' and 'rightSpine' assume we have the following
-- type and prisms given:
--
-- >>> data Expr = EFun String | EApp Expr Int | ELam String Expr deriving (Show)
-- >>> let _EApp = prism (uncurry EApp) (\e0 -> case e0 of {EApp e1 a -> Right (e1, a); _ -> Left e0})
-- >>> let _ELam = prism (uncurry ELam) (\e0 -> case e0 of {ELam x e1 -> Right (x, e1); _ -> Left e0})

-- | Turn a 'Prism'' for a left associative constructor of an AST into an 'Iso''
-- between the normal AST representation and a representation where the left
-- spine has been unwound.
--
-- >>> (EApp (EApp (EFun "f") 1) 2) ^. leftSpine _EApp
-- (EFun "f",[1,2])
--
-- >>> leftSpine _EApp # (EFun "g", [3,4])
