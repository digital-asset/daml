Daml 3 Unstable Script Library
==============================

The Daml Script library defines the API used to implement Daml scripts. See :doc:`/daml-script/index`:: for more information on Daml script.
NOTE: This is the unstable Daml 3 script library replacement. It can and will make breaking changes without warning up to the release of Daml 3.0.
This library will also _only_ compile against LF 1.dev.
