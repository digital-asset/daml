# Documentation

For the user-facing DAML documentation, see [/docs/](/docs/).

In this directory:

* `daml-contract-keys` contains draft documentation for Contract Keys and Quantities

* `daml-licenses` produces a document containing the licenses of all of our dependencies.

* `time-model` provides documentation on the time model used by DAML

You can preview any of these locally by:

1. `cd` into the appropriate folder
2. Run `da-doc-preview`
3. Go to <http://localhost:8081>
