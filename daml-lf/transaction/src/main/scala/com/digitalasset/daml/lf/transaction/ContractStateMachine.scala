/** Implements a state machine for contracts and their keys while interpreting a Daml-LF command
  * or iterating over a [[com.daml.lf.transaction.HasTxNodes]] in execution order.
  * The contract state machine keeps track of the updates to the [[ContractStateMachine.ActiveLedgerState]]
  * since the beginning of the interpretation or iteration.
  * The interpretation or iteration must signal every node (to be)
  * to the [[ContractStateMachine.State]] using its methods.
  *
  * If [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.byKeyOnly]] is not set,
  * the [[ContractStateMachine.ActiveLedgerState.keys]] and [[ContractStateMachine.State.keyInputs]]
  * keeps track of all keys that appear in any of the nodes, and errors on any internal key inconsistencies.
  * [[com.daml.lf.transaction.Node.LookupByKey]] can be handled with [[ContractStateMachine.State.handleLookup]].
  *
  * If [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.byKeyOnly]] is set,
  * the contract state machine does not detect inconsistent key lookups
  * and the [[ContractStateMachine.ActiveLedgerState.keys]] and [[ContractStateMachine.State.keyInputs]]
  * keep track only of keys that have been brought into scope using a by-key node
  * or a [[com.daml.lf.transaction.Node.Create]] node.
  * In this mode, [[com.daml.lf.transaction.Node.LookupByKey]] nodes must be
  * handled with [[ContractStateMachine.State.handleLookupWith]],
  * whose second argument takes the contract key resolution to be given to the Daml interpreter instead of
  * [[com.daml.lf.transaction.Node.LookupByKey.result]].
  * This is because the iteration might currently be within a rollback scope
  * that has already archived a contract with the key without a by-key operation
  * (and for this reason the archival is not tracked in [[ContractStateMachine.ActiveLedgerState.keys]]),
  * i.e., the lookup resolves to [[scala.None$]] but the correct key input is [[scala.Some$]] for some contract ID
  * and this may matter after the rollback scope is left.
  *
  * Note that the engine is also used in Cantonâ€™s non-uck (unique contract key) mode.
  * In that mode, duplicate keys should not be an error. We provide no stability
  * guarantees for this mode at this point so tests can be changed freely.
  *
  * @tparam Nid Type parameter for [[com.daml.lf.transaction.NodeId]]s during interpretation.
  *             Use [[scala.Unit]] for iteration.
  *
  * @see com.daml.lf.transaction.HasTxNodes.contractKeyInputs for an iteration in mode
  *      [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.Strict]] and

    *   (but not if there is an entry mapped to [[KeyInactive]]), will we ask the ledger.
    *
    *   How this map is mutated depends on the [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode]]:
    *   - In modes [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.Off]]
    *     and [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.On]], i.e., [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.byKeyOnly]],
    *     the following operations mutate this map:
    *     1. fetch-by-key/lookup-by-key/exercise-by-key/create-contract-with-key will insert an
    *        an entry in the map if there wasnâ€™t already one (i.e., if they queried the ledger).
    *     2. ACS mutating operations if the corresponding contract has a key update the entry. Specifically,
    *        2.1. A create will set the corresponding map entry to KeyActive(cid) if the contract has a key.
    *        2.2. A consuming choice on cid will set the corresponding map entry to KeyInactive
    *             iff we had a KeyActive(cid) entry for the same key before. If not, keys
    *             will not be modified. Later lookups have an activeness check
    *             that can then set this to KeyInactive if the result of the
    *             lookup was already archived.
    *
    *  - In mode [[com.daml.lf.transaction.ContractKeyUniquenessMode.Strict]],
    *    all operations involving a contract with a key update this map.
