/** SExpr0 -- AST for the speedy compiler pipeline.
  *
  * These are *not* the expression forms which run on the speedy machine. See SExpr.
  *
  * These are the expression forms which exist during the speedy compiler pipeline:
  * The pipeline stages are:
  *
  * 1: convert from LF
  *     - reducing binding forms (update & scenario becoming builtins)
  *     - moving to de Bruijn indexing for variable
  *     - moving to multi-argument applications and abstractions.
  *
  * 2: closure conversion
  * 3: transform to ANF
  * 4: validate the final expression which will run on the speedy machine
  *
  * Stage 1 is in Compiler.scala
  * Stage 2 is in ClosureConversion.scala
  * Stage 3 is in Anf.scala
  * Stage 4 is in ValidateCompilation.scala
  *
  * During Stage2 (Closure Conversion), we move from SExpr0 to SExpr1,
  * During Stage3 (ANF transformation), we move from SExpr1 to SExpr.
  *
  * Summary of which constructors are contained by: SExp0, SExpr1 and SExpr:
  *
  * - In SExpr{0,1,} (everywhere): SEAppGeneral, SEBuiltin, SELabelClosure,
  *   SELocation, SEScopeExercise, SETryCatch, SEVal, SEValue,
  *
  * - In SExpr0: SEAbs, SEVar
  *
  * - In SExpr{0,1}: SECase, SELet
  *
  * - In SExpr{1,}: SELocA, SELocF, SELocS, SEMakeClo, SELet1General,
  *
  * - In SExpr: SEAppAtomicFun, SEAppAtomicGeneral, SEAppAtomicSaturatedBuiltin,
  *   SECaseAtomic, SELet1Builtin, SELet1BuiltinArithmetic
  *
  * - In SExpr (runtime only, i.e. rejected by validate): SEDamlException, SEImportValue
