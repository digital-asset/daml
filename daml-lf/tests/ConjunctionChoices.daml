-- The `demo` scenario below demonstrates
-- (1) a successful exercise of a choice with two controllers (necessarily in
--     the body of another choice),
-- (2) a failing attempt to exercise a choice with two controllers by the
--     wrong two actors,
-- (3) a failing attempt to exercise a choice with two controllers by just one
--     of them,
-- (4) a successful exercise of a choice with two controllers that actually
--     coincide through a direct commit.
