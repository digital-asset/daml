      * The following description borrowed from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions-0.10.1/docs/Control-Monad-Catch.html#v:bracket
      * {{{
      * Generalized abstracted pattern of safe resource acquisition and release in the face of errors.
      * The first action "acquires" some value, which is "released" by the second action at the end.
      * The third action "uses" the value and its result is the result of the bracket.
      *
      * If an error is thrown during the use, the release still happens before the error is rethrown.
      * }}}
      *
      * If cleanup fails, it's error returned. If you don't like this behavior, don't return a Failure from the cleanup.
      * If both flatMap and cleanup fail, flatMap's Failure returned.
      *
      * Examples:
      *
      * {{{
      *  private def parseDalfNamesFromManifest(darFile: ZipFile): Try[Dar[String]] =
      *    bracket(Try(darFile.getInputStream(manifestEntry)))(close)
      *      .flatMap(is => readDalfNamesFromManifest(is))
      *
      *  private def parseOne(f: ZipFile)(s: String): Try[A] =
      *    bracket(getZipEntryInputStream(f, s))(close).flatMap(parseDalf)

      *  private def close(is: InputStream): Try[Unit] = Try(is.close())
      * }}}
      *
