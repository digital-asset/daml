-- | Initiate / Accept template to open an account.
-- The account is created using an `Account.Factory` template. By doing so, our workflow is generic
-- and does not depend on the specific account implementation. For the same reason, we need to
-- provide a `Holding.Factory` that will be used by the account to create holdings without depending
-- on the specific implementation.
