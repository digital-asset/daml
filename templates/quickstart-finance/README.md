# Code Samples - Getting Started

Note - This project is currently an Early Access 'Alpha' feature (see [here](https://docs.daml.com/support/status-definitions.html) for more information).

This project contains the source code used in the getting-started tutorials.

Before opening Visual Studio Code you should run `./get-dependencies.sh` (or `get-dependencies.bat` for WinOS users) to download the required Daml packages.

You can then open Daml Studio by running `daml studio`, or build the project using `daml build`. To run the project, run `daml start` (which also builds the project).
