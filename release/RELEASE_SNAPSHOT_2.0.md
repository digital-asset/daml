# Making a Snapshot Release (2.x)

1. Open a PR on the [DACH-NY/assembly] repo using either the Canton
   version that just got released (for a stable release) or the latest nightly
   snapshot (for a snapshot). See the instructions in the README of the
   [DACH-NY/assembly] repo for details.

1. Merge the PR and wait for the corresponding `main` build to finish.
