popper.js
^^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `popper.js@1.14.4 <https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
  
  License
  
  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
  CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
  PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
  WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
  PROHIBITED.
  
  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
  AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
  LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
  THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
  
  1. Definitions
  
     1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
  and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
  derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
  literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
  cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
  recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
  derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
  Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
  this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
  work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
  timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
  Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
     2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
  such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
  broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
  in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
  arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
  which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
  with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
  independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
  collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
  considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
  License.
     3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
  and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
  other transfer of ownership.
     4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
  that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
     5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
  work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the
  Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher;
  and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
  musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
  play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
  expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
  being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
  performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
  organization that transmits the broadcast.
     6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
  terms of this License including without limitation any production in
  the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode
  or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
  pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
  of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
  choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
  composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
  assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
  a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
  lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
  expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
  art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
  relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
  performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
  extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
  a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
  considered a literary or artistic work.
     7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
  License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
  respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
  Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
  violation.
     8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
  Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
  means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
  digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
  way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
  at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
  public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
  the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
  to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
  sounds or images.
     9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
  including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
  right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including
  storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
  other electronic medium.
  
  2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
  limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
  limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
  copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
  
  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
  Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
  exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
  
     1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
  Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
  Collections;
     2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
  Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
  steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
  were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
  marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
  a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
     3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
  incorporated in Collections; and,
     4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
     5.
  
        For the avoidance of doubt:
           1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
  jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
  statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
  Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
  any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
           2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
  jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
  statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
  waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
  by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
           3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
  to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
  Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
  voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
  You of the rights granted under this License.
  
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
  such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
  in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
  expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
  
  4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
  made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  
     1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
  Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
  ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
  that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
  the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
  and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
  Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
  Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
  measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
  Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
  the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
  incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
  apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
  License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
  must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
  as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
  Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
  practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
  Section 4(b), as requested.
     2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
  Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
  pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the
  Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
  (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
  supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
  another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
  entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
  copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
  name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied;
  (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
  Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
  does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
  the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
  Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
  (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
  "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
  required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable
  manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
  Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
  contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
  part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
  credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
  doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
  purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
  Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
  assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
  Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
  of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
  written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
  Parties.
     3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
  be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
  or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
  Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
  take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
  prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
  agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
  of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
  make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
  modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
  Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
  as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
  applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
  right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
  but not otherwise.
  
  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
  
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
  LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
  TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
  OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
  SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
  LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
  EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  7. Termination
  
     1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
  from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
  terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
  compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
  survive any termination of this License.
     2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
  here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
  Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
  release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
  the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
  not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
  been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
  and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
  terminated as stated above.
  
  8. Miscellaneous
  
     1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
  Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
  on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
  this License.
     2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
  Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
  same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
  License.
     3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
  under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
  enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
  without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
  such provision valid and enforceable.
     4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
  no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
  writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
  consent.
     5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
  parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work
  not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
  provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License
  may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the
  Licensor and You.
     6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
  this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
  amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
  Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
  of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
  1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
  jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
  according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
  those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
  standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
  includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
  additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
  License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
  applicable law.

  Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
  alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
  which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
  litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
  in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
  within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
  infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
  License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
  is filed.
  
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
  the following conditions:

  a copy of this License; and
  
  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that You changed the files; and
  
  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that

  such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
  part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
  within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
  within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
  Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
  Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
  contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
  not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
  within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
  addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
  additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
  License.
  
  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
  in this License.
  
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
  You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
  License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding

  CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
  limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
  redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
  exercise of permissions under this License.
  
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
  required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
  acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
  for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
  consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
  License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
  not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
  failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
  losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
  of such damages.
  
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and
  charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
  liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
  However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
  behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
  Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
  Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
  against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
  warranty or additional liability.

  ci.org/epeli/underscore.string) #
  
  
  
  Javascript lacks complete string manipulation operations.
  This an attempt to fill that gap. List of build-in methods can be
  found
  for example from [Dive Into JavaScript][d].
  
  [d]: http://www.diveintojavascript.com/core-javascript-reference/the-
  string-object
  
  
  As name states this an extension for [Underscore.js][u] (and [Lo-
  Dash](http://lodash.com/)), but it can be used
  independently from **_s**-global variable. But with Underscore.js you
  can
  use Object-Oriented style and chaining:
  
  [u]: http://underscorejs.org/
  
  ```javascript
  _("   epeli  ").chain().trim().capitalize().value()
  => "Epeli"
  ```

    * [Production version](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/ra
  w/master/dist/underscore.string.min.js) *Minified 7kb*
  
  
  ## Node.js installation ##
  
  **npm package**
  
      npm install underscore.string
  
  **Standalone usage**:
  
  ```javascript
  var _s = require('underscore.string');
  ```
  
  **Integrate with Underscore.js**:
  
  ```javascript
  var _  = require('underscore');
  
  // Import Underscore.string to separate object, because there are
  conflict functions (include, reverse, contains)
  _.str = require('underscore.string');
  
  // Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace if you want
  _.mixin(_.str.exports());
  
  // All functions, include conflict, will be available through _.str
  object
  _.str.include('Underscore.string', 'string'); // => true
  ```
  
  **Or Integrate with Underscore.js without module loading**
  
  Run the following expression after Underscore.js and Underscore.string
  are loaded
  ```javascript
  // _.str becomes a global variable if no module loading is detected
  // Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace

  ## String Functions ##
  
  For availability of functions in this way you need to mix in
  Underscore.string functions:
  
  ```javascript
  _.mixin(_.string.exports());

  or _.str objects:
  
  ```javascript
  _.str.capitalize('epeli')

  ## Roadmap ##
  
  Any suggestions or bug reports are welcome. Just email me or more
  preferably open an issue.
  
  #### Problems
  
  We lose two things for `include` and `reverse` methods from
  `_.string`:
  
  * Calls like `_('foobar').include('bar')` aren't available;
  * Chaining isn't available too.
  
  But if you need this functionality you can create aliases for conflict
  functions which will be convenient for you:
  
  ```javascript
  _.mixin({
      includeString: _.str.include,
      reverseString: _.str.reverse
  })
  
  // Now wrapper calls and chaining are available.
  _('foobar').chain().reverseString().includeString('rab').value()
  ```
  
  #### Standalone Usage
  
  If you are using Underscore.string without Underscore. You also have
  `_.string` namespace for it and `_.str` alias
  But of course you can just reassign `_` variable with `_.string`
  
  ```javascript
  _ = _.string
  ```

  Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.
  For
  the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
  electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or
  its
  representatives, including but not limited to communication on
  electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
  tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor
  for
  the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
  communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
  writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  on
  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
  Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
  in
  this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
  sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
  applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
  that
  are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
  combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
  Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
  against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
  lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
  the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
  any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
  the
  following conditions:
  
  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
  a
  copy of this License; and
  
  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating
  that You changed the files; and
  
  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
  You
  distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
  from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  
  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  include
  a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
  NOTICE
  file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
  Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
  NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
  the
  Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
  Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
  NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
  License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
  Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
  text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
  cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  
  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
  in this License.
  
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
  You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
  License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
  the
  above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
  separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
  regarding
  such Contributions.
  
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
  to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
  provides
  its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
  CONDITIONS
  OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
  any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
  redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
  exercise of permissions under this License.
  
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
  required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
  acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
  for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
  consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
  License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
  not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
  failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
  losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
  of
  such damages.
  
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge
  a
  fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
  liability
  obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
  accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
  Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
  only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
  harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
  such
  Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
  additional
  liability.
