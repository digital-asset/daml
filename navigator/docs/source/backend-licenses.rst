      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
  
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
  Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
  the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
  modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
  purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces
  of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
  Contribution."
  
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
  Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
  made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
  
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
  
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
  
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
  must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
  or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
  contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
  
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
  
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
  modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
  Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
  the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
  License.
  
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
  reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  granted by a Contributor:
  
  for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
  
  for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
  modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
  Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
  Version); or
  
  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
  its Contributions.
  
  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service
  marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to
  comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
  
  2.4. Subsequent Licenses
  
  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
  License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
  
  2.5. Representation
  
  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
  
  2.6. Fair Use
  
  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.
  
  2.7. Conditions
  
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.
  
  3. Responsibilities
  
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form
  
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including
  any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be
  under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the
  Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of
  this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may
  not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source
  Code Form.
  
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
  
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
  
  such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
  as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
  Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
  reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
  of distribution to the recipient; and
  
  You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
  License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
  license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
  
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
  
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your
  choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this
  License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination
  of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary
  Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such
  Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that
  the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further
  distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).
  
  3.4. Notices
  
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
  
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms
  
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
  Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
  not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear
  that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result
  of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may
  include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
  must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the
  Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited
  by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
  detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand
  it.
  
  5. Termination
  
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if
  You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from
  a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
  until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
  and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You
  of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after
  You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a
  particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
  means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-
  compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
  compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
  
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a
  patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
  to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under
  Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
  
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
  which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this
  License prior to termination shall survive termination.
  
  6. Disclaimer of Warranty
  
  Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
  without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
  including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
  free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-
  infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
  defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
  any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
  warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
  Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
  disclaimer.
  
  7. Limitation of Liability
  
  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
  or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
  liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
  damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
  failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
  losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
  of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
  liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s
  negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
  may not apply to You.
  
  8. Litigation
  
  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of
  that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law
  provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to
  bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
  
  9. Miscellaneous
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
  
  10. Versions of the License
  
  10.1. New Versions
  
  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in
  Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
  modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be
  given a distinguishing version number.
  
  10.2. Effect of New Versions
  
  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered
  Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by
  the license steward.
  
  10.3. Modified Versions
  
  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).
  
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses
  
  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
  
  Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
  
  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
  file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
  
  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.
  
  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
  
  Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice
  
  This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as
  defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
