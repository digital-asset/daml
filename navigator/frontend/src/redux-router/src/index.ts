/**
 * This is Redux middleware for handling History API based routing/URLs. The
 * core idea is that the URL bar is just a special view component. Its state is
 * fully defined by the Redux state and user interactions with the URL bar --
 * like clicking back -- results in a normal Redux action. This middleware
 * manages this given two functions:
 *
 * export interface RouterOptions<S> {
 *   stateToUrl(state: S): URL;
 *   urlToAction(url: URL): Action;
 * }
 *
 * Upon initialisation, an action for the initial URL will be dispatched
 * immediately.
