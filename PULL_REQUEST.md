# Pull Request: DAML Repository Improvements

## üìã Summary

This pull request introduces comprehensive improvements to the DAML repository, focusing on build performance, developer experience, and CI/CD pipeline optimization.

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. Build Performance Optimizations
- **Bazel Configuration**: Added performance optimizations to `.bazelrc`
  - `--jobs=auto` for optimal parallelization
  - `--local_cpu_resources=HOST_CPUS-1` for CPU resource management
  - `--local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*0.8` for memory optimization
- **Build Scripts**: Enhanced build scripts with performance monitoring
- **Cache Optimization**: Improved disk and remote cache utilization

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements
- **Azure Pipelines**: Added performance optimizations to build configurations
- **Resource Management**: Optimized CPU and memory allocation for build jobs
- **Parallel Execution**: Improved test and build parallelization

### 3. Developer Experience Improvements
- **Setup Script**: Created `setup-dev-env.sh` for streamlined development environment setup
- **Performance Monitor**: Added `sdk/scripts/performance-monitor.sh` for build performance analysis
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive improvement documentation in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### 4. Security Enhancements
- **Dependency Updates**: Added security resolutions for vulnerable packages
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Enhanced security scanning in pre-commit configuration
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Added npm audit integration

### 5. Documentation Improvements
- **README Updates**: Enhanced main README with improvement highlights
- **Improvement Documentation**: Detailed `IMPROVEMENTS.md` with technical details
- **Setup Instructions**: Clear setup and usage instructions
