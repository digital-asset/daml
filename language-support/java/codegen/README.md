Java Codegen
============

Tests
-----

The codegen code source is provided with two sets of tests: 

- The standard tests (under ``src/test/java-*`` directory) which are based on 
  dar files produced by ``daml-lf-encoder``. Hence those test do not 
  dependent on DAML compilers. Those tests are designed to test the codegen 
  with precise features of LF, even if the compiler do not support them.
  
- The integration tests (under ``src/it/java-*`` directory) which are based on 
  dar files produced by different version of the SDK. Those tests are here to 
  test the codegen on daml-lf patterns generated by the compiler and verify 
  backward compatibility.
  
Each one of those sets test the codegen with different versions of daml-lf. 
Some the versions are however missing, and should ideally be implemented in the 
future.
