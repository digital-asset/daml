# The 'build-and-lint' (test) target:
#  - Causes 'daml2ts-test.dar' to be produced (from the sources under 'ts/daml');
#  - Invokes 'daml2ts' on that dar to produce typescript bindings in' ts/generated/src/daml';
#  - Invokes 'yarn install' in 'ts' to install dependencies;
#  - Invokes 'yarn build' then 'yarn lint' on each of the 'daml-json-types', 'daml-ledger-fetch' and 'generated' packages;
#  - Invokes 'yarn test' from the 'ts/generated' directory.
# That last step causes 'ts/generated/src/tests/__tests__/test.ts' to be executed which:
#  - Spins up a sandbox running the 'daml2ts-test.dar';
#  - Spins up a http-json-api connected to the sandbox;
#  - Evaluates assertions of http-json-api specified ledger operations involving contracts defined by the dar;
#  - Gracefully tears down the processes it started when its work is done.
# All in all, a pretty slick bit of work!
