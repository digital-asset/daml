# @daml/types

> Primitive types of the DAML language and their serialization.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for `@daml/types` can be found
[here](https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/bindings-ts/daml-types/index.html).

## Description 

This library contains TypeScript types corresponding to primitive DAML data types, such as
`Template`, `ContractId`, `Int`, `Text` etc. as well as their encoders and decoders to interact with
the [JSON API](https://docs.daml.com/json-api/index.html) of a DAML ledger.

For creating a DAML distributed application, you'll most likely want to use the
[@daml/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daml/react) and
[@daml/ledger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daml/ledger) packages.
