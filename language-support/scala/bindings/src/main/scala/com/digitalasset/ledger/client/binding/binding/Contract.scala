/**
  * A class representing a DAML contract of specific type (DAML template) with assigned contract ID and agreement text.
  *
  * @param contractId     Contract ID.
  * @param value          Contract instance as defined in DAML template (without `contractId` and `agreementText`).
  * @param agreementText  Agreement text. `None` means that we did not receive the `agreementText` from the server.
  *                       `Some("")` is a valid case, this means that the contract has `agreementText` set to an empty string
  *                       or agreement was not defined in DAML, which defaults to an empty string.
  * @param signatories    Signatories of the contract as defined in the DAML template
  * @param observers      Observers of the contract, both explicitly as defined in the DAML template and implicitly as
  *                       choice controllers.
  * @param key            The value of the key of this contract, if defined by the template.
  *
  * @tparam T             Contract template type parameter.
