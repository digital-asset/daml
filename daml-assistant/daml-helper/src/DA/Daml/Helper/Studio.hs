-- [Note cmd.exe and why everything is horrible]
--
-- cmd.exe has a terrible behavior where it strips the first and last
-- quote under certain conditions, quoting cmd.exe /?:
--
-- > 1.  If all of the following conditions are met, then quote characters
-- >     on the command line are preserved:
-- >
-- >     - no /S switch
-- >     - exactly two quote characters
-- >     - no special characters between the two quote characters,
-- >       where special is one of: &<>()@^|
-- >     - there are one or more whitespace characters between the
-- >       the two quote characters
-- >     - the string between the two quote characters is the name
-- >       of an executable file.
-- >
-- > 2.  Otherwise, old behavior is to see if the first character is
-- >     a quote character and if so, strip the leading character and
-- >     remove the last quote character on the command line, preserving
-- >     any text after the last quote character.
--
-- By adding a quote at the beginning and the end, we always fall into 2
-- and the line after stripping the first and last quote corresponds to the one we want.
--
-- To make things worse that does not seem to be sufficient sadly:
-- If we quote `"code"` it seems to result in cmd.exe no longer looking
-- for it in PATH. I was unable to find any documentation or other information
-- on this behavior.
