-- | This module is a workaround for the `output not created` error we
-- see on Windows CI.  We iterate over all AC entries in the cache and
-- look for broken entries with no output and delete those.  This
-- fixes the build for nodes that have only fetched this from the
-- cache.  For other nodes, it looks like a `clean --expunge` is also
-- required (or a full node reset).  See
-- https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/1260 for more
-- information.
