-- | The docs cronjob runs through the following steps
--
-- 1. Download the list of available releases from GH releases.
-- 2. Download the list of available releases from S3 based on the contents of
--    `/versions.json` and `/snapshots.json`.
-- 3. For each version that is in GH but not in S3 run through those steps:
--    3.1. Check if the release has already been uploaded under `/$version/`. If so do nothing.
--         We hit this for the split release process for 2.0 and newer.
--    3.2. If not, build it in the Daml repository and upload.
--         We hit this for the non-split release process.
-- 4. At this point, all releases have been uploaded. What remains to be done is
--    updating the top-level release to the latest stable release that has
--    been marked stable on GH.
-- 5. Finally we update the versions.json and snapshots.json on S3 to match GH.
--
-- This assumes that:
--
-- 1. The assembly repo uploads a release to `/version/` but leaves
--    moving it to the top-level to this cron job.
-- 2. The assembly repo uploads to S3 before creating a GH release.
