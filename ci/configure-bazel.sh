  # Modify the output path to avoid shared action keys.
  # The issue appears to be that GCC produces absolute paths
  # to system includes in .d files. These files are cached
  # so the absolute paths leak into different builds. Most of the time
  # this works since Azure reuses the working directory. However,
  # between the daily compatibility job seems to get a different
  # working directory because it is in a different pipeline.
  # To make matters worse, the working directory depends on which
  # job runs first afaict. There is a counter that simply gets incremented.
  # Sharing between the compatibility workspace and the main workspace
  # runs into the same issue.
  # To sidestep this we take a md5 hash of PWD
  # (this is what bazel does to determine the execroot name).
  # To avoid exceeding the maximum path limit on Windows we limit the suffix to
  # three characters.
