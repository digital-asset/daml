# The `SYSTEM_PULLREQUEST_TARGETBRANCH` environment variable is defined by
# Azure Pipelines; in order to run this script locally, define it beforehand
# as the branch being targeted. For example:
#
#   SYSTEM_PULLREQUEST_TARGETBRANCH=main bash -x ci/check-protobuf-against-stable.sh
#
TARGET="${SYSTEM_PULLREQUEST_TARGETBRANCH:-main}"
echo "The target branch is '${TARGET}'."

# For `main` and PRs targeting `main`, we simply check against the most recent
# stable tag.
#
# For PRs targeting release branches, we should really check against
# all the most recent stable tags reachable from either the current branch or
# from previous release branches (say, against both `1.17.1` and `1.16.2`
# created after the `release/1.17.x` branch).
# Instead, we approximate by checking only against the most recent stable tag
# reachable from the current branch, under the assumption that if a lesser
# release branch contains a protobuf change, then it will also be present in
# higher ones either through a shared commit or a back-port from `main`.
#
# Finally, this check does not need to run on release branch commits because
# they are built sequentially, so no conflicts are possible and the per-PR
# check is enough.
