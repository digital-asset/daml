### Restricted name warnings
Attempting to use the names `this`, `self` or `arg` in template, interface or exception fields will often result in confusing errors, mismatches with the underlying desugared code.  
We now throw an error (or warning) early in those cases on the field name itself to make this more clear.

*Note: Exception as well as templates without any choices did not previously throw errors for both `self` and `arg`. While using these names is discouraged, we only throw a warning here to avoid a breaking change. We may promote this to an error in future.*
