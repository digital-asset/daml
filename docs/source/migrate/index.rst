Migrating DAML ledgers
######################

Building migration projects
---------------------------

When we want to replace a DAML package ``foo-1.0.0`` that is deployed on a DAML ledger with an
updated version, say ``foo-2.0.0``, we need to migrate all the existing contracts that are active
and whose templates are defined in either ``foo-1.0.0`` or whose template definition depends directly
or indirectly on data defined in ``foo-1.0.0``. To help a DAML deployment with this task, the DAML
assistant offers the command ``daml migrate``.

The ``migrate`` command takes as inputs the package ``foo-1.0.0`` and its new version ``foo-2.0.0``
and creates a new project containing generated code to migrate contracts from ``foo-1.0.0`` to
``foo-2.0.0``. Run ``daml migrate --help`` to see its full usage description:

.. code-block:: none

  Usage: daml migrate TARGET_PATH FROM_PATH TO_PATH

  Available options:
    TARGET_PATH              Path where the new project should be located
    FROM_PATH                Path to the dar-package from which to migrate from
    TO_PATH                  Path to the dar-package to which to migrate to
    -h,--help                Show this help text

For example, to create a migration project from ``foo-1.0.0`` to ``foo-2.0.0`` run

.. code-block:: none

  daml migrate foo-upgrade-2.0.0 daml/Foo.daml foo-1.0.0/.daml/dist/foo-1.0.0.dar foo-2.0.0/.daml/dist/foo-2.0.0.dar

This generates a migration project in the directory ``foo-upgrade-2.0.0``. To build it, change
directory to ``foo-upgrade-2.0.0`` and run

.. code-block:: none

  ./build.sh

respectively ``.\build.cmd`` if your on a Windows system.  Note that you can **not** use the usual
``daml build`` command to build the migration project. The `migrate` command will setup the project
and initializes a suitable package database, while ``daml build`` would overwrite this setup again.

How migrations work and when it is necessary to write code manually
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to understand that the ``daml migrate`` command will not always succeed in
generating a migration project that will compile. To understand why, let's assume that the
``foo-1.0.0`` consists of a single module:

.. code-block:: none

  foo-1.0.0
  ├── daml
  │   └── Foo.daml
  ├── daml.yaml
  └── ui-backend.conf

where the ``Foo.daml`` file contains

.. literalinclude:: foo-1.0.0/daml/Foo.daml
  :language: daml
  :lines: 6-14

The package ``foo-2.0.0`` contains exactly the same modules, but a new template ``Bar`` has been
added to the ``Foo`` module.

.. literalinclude:: foo-2.0.0/daml/Foo.daml
  :language: daml
  :lines: 6-21

If we generate a migration project with ``daml migrate`` as above, the directory contents of the
``foo-2.0.0-upgrade/daml`` directory is

.. code-block:: none

  daml
  ├── FooAInstances.daml
  ├── FooBInstances.daml
  └── Foo.daml

For every template that was defined in the module ``Foo`` in the ``foo-1.0.0`` package, you will
find two new templates. One to upgrade contract instances of this template to the changed template
defined in the module ``Foo`` in the package ``foo-2.0.0`` and one to rollback the process. Here is
an example:

.. literalinclude:: foo-upgrade-2.0.0/daml/Foo.daml
  :language: daml
  :lines: 4-14

The new template types are defined via a type alias and use generic templates to update or rollback
contract instances defined in the DAML standard library (see
https://docs.daml.com/daml/reference/base.html#module-da-upgrade). The ``Upgrade`` template offers a
choice to input a contract instance defined in ``foo-1.0.0`` and create a new one that has been
converted to a contract instance defined in ``foo-2.0.0``. The ``Rollback`` template implements the
reversed workflow.

The last line generates a ``Convertible`` instance for the ``Foo`` template of both packages. This
is a manifestation that instances of the ``Foo`` template in ``foo-1.0.0`` can be converted to
instances of the equally named template in ``foo-2.0.0``. The migrate command tries to infer the
instances of the ``Convertible`` type class automatically via generics and takes care of defining
generic instances for all relevant data types in the two packages. In our example, you'll find them
in the files ``FooAInstances.daml`` and ``FooBInstances.daml``.

Generic representations can be converted when they are *isomorphic*. That means the corresponding
data types defined in package ``foo-1.0.0`` and ``foo-2.0.0`` have exactly the same shape. For
example the following two data types are isomorphic:

.. code-block:: daml

  data Either a b = Left a | Right b
  data UpDown a b = Up a | Down b

while the following data types are not

.. code-block:: daml

  data Either a b = Left a | Right b
  data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

When the package ``foo-2.0.0`` contains an extended data type of the ``Foo`` template that is not
isomorphic, the build will fail. For example, let's assume the ``Foo`` module in the ``foo-2.0.0``
package has been extended to

.. literalinclude:: foo-2.0.0/daml/FooEmbedding.daml
  :language: daml
  :lines: 6-15

Here is typical error message in this case of an invocation of ``build.sh``:

.. code-block:: none

  daml/Foo.daml:10:10: error:
  • No instance for (GenConvertible
  (DA.Generics.M1
  DA.Generics.S
  ('DA.Generics.MetaSel
  ('DA.Generics.MetaSel0
  ('Some "p")
  ...

The important hint is that the compiler is not able to deduce that our data type is an instance of
the ``DA.Upgrade.GenConvertible`` class and hence not generically convertible. In this case you will
have to implement a ``convert`` method that describes how to convert a contract of the template in
question of package ``foo-1.0.0`` to one of ``foo-2.0.0`` and vice versa. For example

.. literalinclude:: foo-upgrade-2.0.0/daml/FooManual.daml
  :language: daml
  :lines: 4-19

Deploying the migration
-----------------------

Once you've succeeded building the ``foo-upgrade-2.0.0`` package you can deploy it on the ledger
together with the ``foo-2.0.0`` package. Optionally you can bundle it with the ``foo-2.0.0`` package
into a single DAML archive by running

.. code-block:: none

  daml damlc merge-dars foo-2.0.0/.daml/dist/foo-2.0.0.dar foo-upgrade-2.0.0/.daml/dist/foo-upgrade-2.0.0.dar --package-name foo-2.0.0-with-upgrades.dar

You find more information on how to deploy DAML archive packages :ref:`here <deploy-ref_index>` .
After the ``foo-upgrade-2.0.0`` package has been deployed on the ledger, there exists for every
contract defined in ``foo-1.0.0`` a DAML workflow with a choice to upgrade it to ``foo-2.0.0`` or
roll it back.
