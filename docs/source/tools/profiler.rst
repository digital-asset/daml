Daml Profiler
#############

The Daml Profiler is only available in
`Daml Enterprise <https://www.digitalasset.com/products/daml-enterprise>`_.

The Daml Profiler allows you to to profile execution of your Daml code
which can help spot bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.

Usage
=====

To test this out, we use the skeleton project included in the
assistant. We first create the project and build the DAR.

.. code-block:: sh

  daml new profile-tutorial --template skeleton
  cd profile-tutorial
  daml build

Next we load the DAR into Sandbox with a special ``profile-dir``
option. Sandbox will behave as usual but all profile results will be
written to that directory. For this, we first create a configuration
file that sets the ``profile-dir`` for Sandbox:

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: profile.conf

   canton.participants.sandbox.features.profile-dir = profile-results

We then pass

.. code-block:: sh

   daml sandbox --dar .daml/dist/profile-tutorial-0.0.1.dar -c profile.conf

To actually produce some profile results, we have to create
transactions. For the purposes of this tutorial, the Daml Script
included in the skeleton project does the job admirably:

.. code-block:: sh

   daml script --dar .daml/dist/profile-tutorial-0.0.1.dar --ledger-host localhost --ledger-port 6865 --script-name Main:setup

If we now look at the contents of the ``profile-results`` directory,
we can see one JSON file per transaction produced by the script. Each
file has a name of the form ``$timestamp-$command.json`` where
``$timestamp`` is the submission time of the transaction and
``$command`` is a human-readable description of the command that
produced the transaction (for multi-command submissions, only the
first one will be in the file name).

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ls profile-results
   2021-03-17T12:32:16.846404Z-create:Asset.json
   2021-03-17T12:32:17.361596Z-exercise:Asset:Give.json
   2021-03-17T12:32:17.623537Z-exercise:Asset:Give.json

At this point, you can stop Sandbox.

To view the profiling results you can use
`speedscope <https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope>`_.
The easiest option is to
use the `web version <https://www.speedscope.app/>`_ but you can also
install it
`locally <https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope#command-line-usage>`_.

Let’s open the first exercise profile above ``2021-03-17T12:32:17.361596Z-exercise:Asset:Give.json``:

   .. image:: profiler/images/speedscope.png
      :align: center
      :width: 100%
      :alt: Speedscope results for the first exercise profile. The first activity is just after the 4.00 ms mark.

You can see the exercise as the root of the profile. Below that there
are a few expressions to calculate signatories, observer and
controllers and finally we see the create of the contract. In this
simple example, nothing obvious stands out that we could do to
optimize further.

Speedscope provides a few other views that can be useful depending on
your profile. Refer to the
`documentation <https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope#views>`_
for more information on that.

Caveats
=======

1. The profiler currently does not take time into account that is
   spent outside of pure interpretation, e.g., time needed to fetch a
   contract from the database.

2. The profiler operates on Daml-LF. This means that the identifiers
   used in the profiler correspond to Daml-LF expressions which
   includes autogenerated identifiers used by the compiler. E.g., in
   the example above, ``Main:$csignatory`` is the name of the function
   used to compute signatories of ``Asset``. You can view the Daml-LF
   code that the compiler generated using ``daml damlc inspect``. This
   can be useful to see where an identifier is being used but it does
   take some experience to be able to read Daml-LF code with ease.

.. code-block:: sh

   daml damlc inspect .daml/dist/profiler-tutorial-0.0.1.dar
