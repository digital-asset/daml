Visualizing DAML Contracts
##########################

You can generate visual graphs for the contracts in your DAML project. To do this:

1. Install `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/download/>`_.
2. Generate a DAR from your project by running ``daml build``.
3. Generate a `dot file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>`_ from that DAR by running ``daml damlc visual <path_to_project>/dist/<project_name.dar> --dot <project_name>.dot``
4. Generate the visual graph with Graphviz by running ``dot -Tpng <project_name>.dot > <project_name>.dot.png``
