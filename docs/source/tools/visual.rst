Visualizing Daml Contracts
##########################

Visualizing Daml Contracts is currently an :doc:`Early Access Feature in Labs status </support/status-definitions>`.

You can generate visual graphs for the contracts in your Daml project. To do this:

1. Install `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/download/>`_.
2. Generate a DAR from your project by running ``daml build``.
3. Generate a `dot file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>`_ from that DAR by running ``daml damlc visual <path_to_project>/dist/<project_name.dar> --dot <project_name>.dot``
4. Generate the visual graph with Graphviz by running ``dot -Tpng <project_name>.dot > <project_name>.png``


Example: Visualizing the Quickstart project
===========================================

Here's an example visualization based on the :doc:`quickstart </app-dev/bindings-java/quickstart>`. You'll need to `install Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/download/>`_ to try this out.


1. Generate the dar using ``daml build``
2. Generate a dot file ``daml damlc visual dist/quickstart-0.0.1.dar --dot quickstart.dot``
3. Generate the visual graph with Graphviz by running ``dot -Tpng quickstart.dot -o quickstart.png``

Running the above should produce an image which looks something like this:


.. image:: images/quickstart.png
  :width: 30%
  :align: center



Visualizing Daml Contracts - Within IDE
=======================================

You can generate visual graphs from VS Code IDE. Open the daml project in VS Code and use `command palette <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette/>`_. Should reveal a new window pane with dot image. Also visual generates only the currently open daml file and its imports.

Note: You will need to install the Graphviz/dot packages as mentioned above.


Visualizing Daml Contracts - Interactive Graphs
===============================================

This does not require any packages installed. You can generate `D3 <https://d3js.org/>`_ graphs for the contracts in your Daml project. To do this

  1. Generate a DAR from your project by running ``daml build``
  2. Generate HTML file ``daml damlc visual-web .daml/dist/quickstart-0.0.1.dar -o quickstart.html``

Running the above should produce an image which looks something like this:


.. image:: images/d3-visual.png
  :width: 30%
  :align: center
