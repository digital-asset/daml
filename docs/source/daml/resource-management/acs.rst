Managing Latency and Throughput
###############################

Problem definition
******************

Latency is a measure of how long a business transaction takes to complete whilst throughput measures, on average, the minimum and maximum range of business transactions possible per second.

Defense against latency and throughput issues can be written into the Daml application at design time. First, we need to identify the potential bottlenecks in a Daml application and we can do this by analyzing the domain-specific transactions.

Each Daml business transaction kicks off when a Ledger API client sends the commands ``create`` or ``exercise`` to a participant. 

.. important::

    * Ledger transactions are not synonymous with business transactions. 
    * Often a complete business transaction spans multiple workflow steps; thus multiple ledger transactions.
    * Multiple business transactions can be processed in a single ledger transaction through batching.
    * Expected ledger transaction latencies are on the order of 0.5-1 seconds on database sequencers, and multiple seconds on blockchain sequencers.

Refer to the `Daml execution model <../intro/7_Composing.html#daml-s-execution-model>`__  that describes a ledger transaction processed by the Canton ledger. The table below highlights potential resource-intensive activities at each step.

Possible throughput bottlenecks in order of likelihood
------------------------------------------------------

#. Transaction size causing high serialization/deserialization and encryption/decryption costs on participant nodes. 
#. Transaction size causing sequencer backend overload, especially on blockchains.
#. Interpretation and validation cost due to calculation complexity or memory use.
#. Number of involved nodes and associated network bandwidth on sequencer.

Generally, latency is also affected by the above. However, baseline latency is usually more to do with system set up issues (DB or blockchain latency) rather than a Daml modeling problem.

Solutions
---------

#. **Minimize transaction size.** 

Each of the following actions in Daml adds a node to the transaction containing the contract payload of the contract being acted on. A large number of such operations, and/or operations of this kind on large contracts, are the most common cause of performance bottlenecks. 

    * ``create``
    * ``fetch``
    * ``fetchByKey``
    * ``lookupByKey``
    * ``exercise``
    * ``exerciseByKey``
    * ``archive``

Use the above actions sparingly. For example, if contracts have intermediary states within a transaction, you can often skip them by writing only the end-state. For example:

.. code-block:: daml

    template Incrementor
    with
    p : Party
    n : Int
    where
    signatory p
    
    choice Increment : ContractId Incrementor
        controller p
        do create this with n = n+1
    
    -- This adds all m-1 intermediary versions of
    -- the contract to the transaction tree
    choice BadIncrementMany : ContractId Incrementor
        with m : Int
        controller p
        do foldlA (\self' _ -> exercise self' Increment) self [1..m]
    
    -- This only adds the end result to the transaction
    choice GoodIncrementMany : ContractId Incrementor
        with m : Int
        controller p
        do create this with n = n+m

When you need to read a contract, or act on a single contract in multiple ways, you can often bundle those operations into a single action. For example:

.. code-block:: daml

    template Asset
 with
   issuer : Party
   owner : Party
   quantity : Decimal
 where
   signatory [issuer, owner]
 
   -- BadMerge acts on each of the otherCids three times:
   -- Once for validation
   -- Once to extract the quantities
   -- Once to archive
   choice BadMerge : ContractId Asset
     with otherCids : [ContractId Asset]
     controller owner
     do
       -- validate the cids.
       forA_ otherCids (\cid -> do
         other <- fetch cid
         assert (other.issuer == issuer && other.owner == owner))
 
       -- extract the quantities
       quantities <- forA otherCids (\cid -> do
         other <- fetch cid
         return other.quantity)
 
       -- archive the others
       forA_ otherCids archive
 
       create this with quantity = quantity + sum quantities
 
   -- Allow us to do a fetch and an archive in one action
   choice ConsumingFetch : Asset
     controller owner
     do return this
      
   -- GoodMerge only acts on each of the other assets once.
   choice GoodMerge : ContractId Asset
     with otherCids : [ContractId Asset]
     controller owner
     do
       -- Get and archive the others
       others <- forA otherCids (`exercise` ConsumingFetch)
      
       -- validate
       forA_ others (\other -> do
         assert (other.issuer == issuer && other.owner == owner))
 
       -- extract the quantities
       let quantities = map (.quantity) others
 
       create this with quantity = quantity + sum quantities
 

Use separate templates for large payloads that change rarely and require minimum access, and for fields that change with almost every action, to optimize resource consumption for multiple business transactions. 

This batching approach makes updates in one transaction submission rather than having separate transactions for each update. Note: this option can increase latency a little bit and may increase the possibility of command failure but this can be avoided. For example:

.. code-block:: daml

    template T
    with
    p : Party
    where
    signatory p
    
    choice Foo : ()
        controller p
        do return ()
    
    batching : Script ()
    batching = do
    p <- allocateParty "p"
    
    -- without batching we have 10 ledger
    -- transactions.
    cid1 <- submit p do createCmd T with ..
    cid2 <- submit p do createCmd T with ..
    cid3 <- submit p do createCmd T with ..
    cid4 <- submit p do createCmd T with ..
    cid5 <- submit p do createCmd T with ..
    
    submit p do exerciseCmd cid1 Foo
    submit p do exerciseCmd cid2 Foo
    submit p do exerciseCmd cid3 Foo
    submit p do exerciseCmd cid4 Foo
    submit p do exerciseCmd cid5 Foo
    
    -- With batching, there are only two ledger transactions.
    cids <- submit p do
    replicateA 5 $ createCmd T with ..
    submit p do
    forA_ cids (`exerciseCmd` Foo)

2. CPU and memory issues: Use the `Daml profiler <../tools/profiler.html>`__ to analyze Daml code execution. 
3. Once you feel interpretation is not the bottleneck, scale up your machine.

.. tip::

    Profile the JVM and monitor your databases to see where the bottlenecks occur.

Managing Active Contract Set (ACS) Size
#######################################

Problem definition
******************

The Active Contract Set (ACS) size makes up the load related to the number of active contracts in the system at any one time. It means the totality of all the contracts that have been created but not yet archived. ACS size may come from a deliberate Daml workflow design, but the size may also be unexpected when insufficient care is given to supporting and auxiliary contract lifetimes.

.. tip::

    See the documentation on `Daml contracts <../intro/1_Token.html#basic-contracts>`__ for more information.

In Daml systems, ACS size can reach orders of magnitude higher than synonymous loads in common database or blockchain systems. When the ACS size is in the high 100s GBs or TBs, local database access performance may deteriorate. We will look at potential issues around large ACS size and possible solutions.


Relational databases
********************

Large ACS can have a negative impact on many aspects of system performance in relational databases. The following points focus on PostgreSQL as the underlying database; the details differ in the case of Oracle but the results are similar.

* Large ACS size directly affects the resource consumption and performance of a Ledger API client application dealing with a large data set that may not fit into the memory or the application database.
* The size directly affects the speed at which the ACS can be transmitted from the Ledger API server using the ActiveContractService. In extreme cases, it could take hours to transfer the complete set requested by the application due to the limits imposed by the gRPC channel capacity and the speed of storage queries.
* Increased latency is a less direct impact which shows up wherever a query is issued to the database index to make progress. Large ACS size means that the corresponding indices are also rather big, and at a certain point they will no longer fit into the shared-buffer space. It then takes increasingly longer for the database engine to produce query results. This affects activities such as contract lookups during the command submission, transaction tree streaming, or pointwise transaction lookups.
* Large ACS may affect the speed at which the database underpinning the participant ingests new transactions. Normally, as new updates pour in, the write-ahead log commits the table and index changes immediately. Those updates come in two shapes; full-page writes or differential writes. With large volumes, many are full-page writes. 
* Finally, many dirty pages also translate into prolonged and expensive flush to the disk as part of the checkpointing process.


Solutions
---------

* Pay attention to the lifetime of the contracts. Make sure that the supporting and auxiliary contracts don’t clutter the ACS and archive them as soon as it is practical to do so.
* Set up a frequent pruning schedule. Be aware that pruning is only effective if there are archived contracts available for pruning. If all contracts are still active, pruning has limited success. Refer to our `pruning documentation <../../canton/usermanual/pruning.html>`__ for more information.
* Implement an ODS in your ledger client application to limit the reliance on read access to the ACS. Do this whenever you notice that the time to initialize the application from the ACS exceeds your pain level.
* Monitor database performance. 
    * Monitor the disk read and disk write activity. Look for sudden changes in the operation patterns. For instance, a sudden uplift in the disk’s read activity may be a sign of indices no longer fitting into the shared buffers.
    * Observe the performance of the database queries. Check our monitoring documentation for `query metrics <../../canton/usermanual/monitoring.html#daml-index-db-operation-query>`__ that can assist. You may also consider setting up a `log_min_duration_statement parameter <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html>`__ in the PostgreSQL configuration.
* Set up `autovacuum <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/routine-vacuuming.html>`__ on the PostgreSQL database. Note that, after pruning, a lot of dead tuples will need removing.

HTTP JSON API Service
*********************

We recommend using a relational database and dedicated compute resources to manage large ACS size when using the HTTP JSON API and refer the reader to the above considerations. 

.. tip::

    See the HTTP JSON API service documentation on `managing high load in the query store <../../json-api/production-setup/query-store.html#behavior-under-high-load>`__ and `server scaling and redundancy <../../json-api/production-setup/scaling-and-redundancy.html>`__ for more information.
