module Token where

-- Contract Templates define a type of contract that can exist on the ledger,
-- together with its data, and involved parties.

-- | `Token` is a contract that has no state other than its existence and
-- who holds the `Token` stored in field `owner`.
template Token
  -- Each `template` has a `with` block defining the data type of the data
  -- stored on an instance of that contract.
  -- Blocks are indicated through indentation. The `template` is a block so
  -- `with` is indented. The contents of the `with` block are indented further.
  with
    -- `owner` is the only field on an instance of `Token`. It has type
    -- `Party`, which is an inbuilt type representing an entity present on
    -- the ledger
    owner : Party
  -- Following the `with` block is a `where` block, which gives the contract
  -- meaning by defining the roles parties play and how contract instances can
  -- be transformed.
  where
    -- Every `template` has a `signatory` expression in its `where` block.
    -- The `signatory` expression defines one or more _parties_ to be
    -- _signatories_. The signatories must authorize the creation of a
    -- contract instance and verify the validity of any action performed on it.
    signatory owner
