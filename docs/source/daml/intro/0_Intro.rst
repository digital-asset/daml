An introduction to DAML
=======================

DAML is a smart contract language designed to build composable applications on an abstract :ref:`da-ledgers`. In this introduction, you will build an asset-holding and -trading application, and in the process learn about the structure of a DAML Ledger, and how to write DAML applications that run on any DAML Ledger implementation. You will gain an overview over most important language features, how they relate to the :ref:`da-ledgers` and how to use the DAML SDK Tools to write, test, compile, package and ship your application.

This introduction is structured such that each section presents a new self-contained application with more functionality than that from the previous section. You can find the DAML code for each section `here <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/docs/source/daml/intro/daml>`_.

Prerequisites:

- You have installed the DAML SDK
