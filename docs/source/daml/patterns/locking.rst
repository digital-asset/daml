Locking
#######

The Locking pattern exhibits how to achieve locking safely and efficiently in DAML. Only the specified locking party can lock the asset through an active and authorized action. When a contract is locked, some or all choices specified on that contract may not be exercised.

Motivation

Locking is a common real-life requirement in business transactions. During the clearing and settlement process, once a trade is registered and novated to a central Clearing House, the trade is considered locked-in. This means the securities under the ownership of seller need to be locked so they cannot be used for other purposes, and so should be the funds on the buyer's account. The locked state should remain throughout the settlement Payment versus Delivery process. Once the ownership is exchanged, the lock is lifted for the new owner to have full access.

Implementation
