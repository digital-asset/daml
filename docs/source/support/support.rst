Support and feedback
====================

Have questions or feedback? You're in the right place.

- **Questions: Stack Overflow**

  For “how do I?”, “why does something work this way” or “I’ve got a programming problem I’m trying to solve” questions, the `daml tag on Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/daml>`_ is the best place to ask. 

  If you're not sure what makes a good question, take a look at `this checklist <https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/>`_. 
- ** Help and feedback: Slack, or Support widget**

  If you want to give feedback, or have questions that aren't right for Stack Overflow, you can: 

  - Join the DAML community on `Slack <https://damldriven.slack.com/sso/saml/start>`_.
  - Ask us for help using the `Support <javascript:open_feedback()>`_ link on any documentation page.

Support expectations
--------------------

For community users (ie on Slack and Stack Overflow):

- **Timing**: We'll try to get back to you in two business days.

  Our main offices are in Zurich and New York, and we don't consider public holidays in those locations to be business days.

- **Public support**: We only offer public support - for example, on the ``#public`` channel in `Slack <https://damldriven.slack.com/sso/saml/start>`_. 

  We do not answer questions in private messages or over email, so please only ask questions in the ``#public`` channel.
- **Level of support**: We're happy to answer questions about error messages you're encountering, or discuss DAML design questions. However, we can't provide more extensive consultation on how to build your DAML application.

If you need private support, or want consultation from DA about how to build your DAML application, we offer paid support. Please contact us to ask about pricing.
