Release notes
#############

This page contains release notes for the SDK.

HEAD — ongoing
--------------

0.12.6 — 2019-04-16
-------------------

- RxJava Bindings: remove blocking call inside Bot.wire, which could lead to an
  application not making progress in certain situations.

0.12.5 — 2019-04-15
-------------------

- Fix release pipeline (hopefully)
- DAML-LF Archive packaging: the DAML-LF Archive Protobuf definitions are now
  packaged so that it's possible to use them without mangling the path.

0.12.4 — 2019-04-15
-------------------

- Release build artifacts to GitHub
- Avoid recompiling packages after resetting the Sandbox via the ResetService.
- Include compiled ``google.rpc.Status`` in the ``ledger-api-scalapb`` jar.
- Fix critical bug related to the conversion of decimal numbers from Ledger API
  (see `#399 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/399>` and
  `#439 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/439>`).

0.12.3 — 2019-04-12
-------------------

- Fix navigator and extractor packaging in the SDK.

0.12.2 — 2019-04-12
-------------------

- Add flexible controllers and disjunction choices to DAML.
- Introduce experimental support for using Postgres as a backend for the
  Sandbox. The optional CLI argument for it named ``--jdbcurl`` is still
  hidden.
- Node.js Bindings: fix validation for Ledger API timestamp values.
- Node.js Bindings: drop support for identifier names, replacing them with
  separated module and entity names.
- Node.js Bindings: use strings instead of numbers to represent Ledger API
  timestamps and dates.
- Node.js Bindings: use strings instead of numbers to represent Protobuf 64-bit
  precision integers to avoid a loss of precision.
- Java Codegen: support DAML TextMap primitive which is mapped to
  ``java.util.Map`` type with keys restricted to ``java.lang.String``
  instances.
- Java Codegen: leaner log output.
- Java Codegen: add flag for log verbosity: ``-V LEVEL`` or ``--verbosity
  LEVEL``, where ``LEVEL`` is a number between ``0`` (least verbose) and ``4``
  (most verbose).
- **BREAKING** Remove support for DAML 1.0 packages in the engine, and thus the
  sandbox. Note that the SDK has removed support for _compiling_ DAML 1.0
  months ago.

0.12.1 — 2019-04-04
-------------------

- Fix release process

0.12.0 — 2019-04-04
-------------------

- Change in how values are addressed in Navigator's `frontend-config.js`.

  - Old syntax for accessing values: `argument.foo.bar`
  - New syntax:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       import { DamlLfValue } from '@da/ui-core';
       // Accessing field 'bar' of field 'foo' of the argument
       DamlLfValue.evalPath(argument, ["foo", "bar"])
       DamlLfValue.toJSON(argument).foo.bar


0.11.32
-------

- DAML standard library (breaking change): Removed ``DA.List.split`` function, which was never intended to be
  exposed and doesn't do what the name suggests.
- Java Bindings (breaking change): Removed type parameter for ``DamlList`` and ``DamlOptional`` classes.
  The ``DamlList``, ``DamlOptional``, and ``ContractId`` classes were previously parameterized (i.e ``DamlList[String]``)
  for consistency with the DAML language. The type parameter has been removed as such type information
  is not supported by the underlying Ledger API and and therefore the parameterized type couldn’t be
  checked for correctness.
- Java Bindings (breaking change): For all classes in the package ``com.daml.ledger.javaapi.data``, we shortened
  the names of the conversion methods from long forms like ``fromProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` and
  ``toProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` to the much shorter ``fromProto`` and ``toProto``.
- Navigator: Add support for Optional and recursive data types.
- Navigator: Improve start up performance for big DAML models.
- Navigator (breaking change): Refactor the GraphQL API. If you're maintaining a modified version of
  the Navigator frontend, you'll need to adapt all your GraphQL queries to the new API.
- Navigator: Fix an issue where it was not possible to enter contract arguments involving contract IDs.
- Navigator: Fix issues where the console could not read some events or commands from its database.
- DAML syntax (breaking change) : For the time being, datatypes with a single data constructor not associated with an argument are not accepted. For example ``data T = T``. To workaround this use ``data T = T {}`` or ``data T = T ()`` (depending on whether you desire ``T`` be interpreted as a product or a sum).

  To convert your code to DAML 1.2, see the :doc:`conversion guide </daml//1-2-conversion>`.
- Documentation: Added a comprehensive :doc:`quickstart guide </getting-started/quickstart>` that replaces the old "My first project" example.

	As part of this, removed the My first project, IOU and PvP examples.

- Documentation: Updated the :doc:`support and feedback page <support>`.

- Ledger API: Version 1.4.0 has support for multi-party subscriptions in the transactions and active contracts services.
- Ledger API: Version 1.4.0 supports the verbose field in the transactions and active contracts services.
- Ledger API: Version 1.4.0 has full support for transaction trees.
- Sandbox: Implements Ledger API version 1.4.0.
- Java Bindings: Examples updated to use version 2.5.2 which implements Ledger API version 1.4.0.
