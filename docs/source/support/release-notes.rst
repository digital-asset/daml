Release notes
#############

This page contains release notes for the SDK.

- Java Code Generator: Supports DAML TextMap primitive which is mapped to ``java.util.Map`` type with keys restricted
  to ``java.lang.String`` instances.
- Java Codegen: Leaner log output and flag for log verbosity ``-V LEVEL`` or ``--verbosity LEVEL``, where ``LEVEL`` is a number between ``0`` (least verbose) and ``4`` (most verbose).
  to ``java.lang.String`` instances.

0.12.0
------

- Change in how values are addressed in Navigator's `frontend-config.js`.
  
  - Old syntax for accessing values: `argument.foo.bar`
  - New syntax: 

    .. code-block:: javascript

       import { DamlLfValue } from '@da/ui-core';
       // Accessing field 'bar' of field 'foo' of the argument
       DamlLfValue.evalPath(argument, ["foo", "bar"])
       DamlLfValue.toJSON(argument).foo.bar


0.11.32
-------

- DAML standard library (breaking change): Removed ``DA.List.split`` function, which was never intended to be
  exposed and doesn't do what the name suggests.
- Java Bindings (breaking change): Removed type parameter for ``DamlList`` and ``DamlOptional`` classes.
  The ``DamlList``, ``DamlOptional``, and ``ContractId`` classes were previously parameterized (i.e ``DamlList[String]``)
  for consistency with the DAML language. The type parameter has been removed as such type information
  is not supported by the underlying Ledger API and and therefore the parameterized type couldnâ€™t be
  checked for correctness.
- Java Bindings (breaking change): For all classes in the package ``com.daml.ledger.javaapi.data``, we shortened
  the names of the conversion methods from long forms like ``fromProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` and
  ``toProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` to the much shorter ``fromProto`` and ``toProto``.
- Navigator: Add support for Optional and recursive data types.
- Navigator: Improve start up performance for big DAML models.
- Navigator (breaking change): Refactor the GraphQL API. If you're maintaining a modified version of
  the Navigator frontend, you'll need to adapt all your GraphQL queries to the new API.
- Navigator: Fix an issue where it was not possible to enter contract arguments involving contract IDs.
- Navigator: Fix issues where the console could not read some events or commands from its database.
- DAML syntax (breaking change) : For the time being, datatypes with a single data constructor not associated with an argument are not accepted. For example ``data T = T``. To workaround this use ``data T = T {}`` or ``data T = T ()`` (depending on whether you desire ``T`` be interpreted as a product or a sum).
