Release notes
#############

This page contains release notes for the SDK.

.. _release-0-13-25:

0.13.25 - 2019-09-18
--------------------

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Suppress instance documentation when `--data-only` mode is requested.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Add CAST_NUMERIC and SHIFT_NUMERIC in DAML-LF 1.dev.
- Change signature of MUL_NUMERIC and DIV_NUMERIC.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix contract key uniqueness check in kvutils.

- Preload packages in a background thread in kvutils.

Ledger
~~~~~~

- ActiveContractsService now specifies to always return at least one message with the offset. This removes a special case where clients would need to check if the stream was empty or not.

- Dramatically increased performance of the ActiveContractService by only loading the contracts that the parties in the transaction filter are allowed to see.

.. _release-0-13-24:

0.13.24 - 2019-09-16
--------------------

Java codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If the DAR source cannot be read, the application crashes and prints an error report.

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Java and Scala codegen is now integrated with the
  assistant and distributed with the SDK. It can be run via ``daml codegen``.
  You can find more information in the `DAML Assistant documentation <https://docs.daml.com/tools/assistant.html>`_.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix bug with qualified imports of generic templates.

Ledger
~~~~~~

- Upgraded ledger-api server H2 Database version to 1.4.199 with stability fixes including one to the ``merge`` statement.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- One more test case added. Transaction service tests are not multi-node aware.
- Semantic tests now ensure synchronization across participants when running in a multi-node setup.

.. _release-0-13-23:

0.13.23 - 2019-09-11
--------------------

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The reference implementation can now spin up multiple nodes, either scaling
  a single participant horizontally or adding new participants. Check the CLI ``--help`` option.
- The test tool now runs the double spend test on a shared contract in a
  multi-node setup (as well as single-node).
- The test tool can now run all semantic test in a multi-node setup.

DAML Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The ``(/)`` operator was moved out of the ``Fractional`` typeclass into a separate ``Divisible`` typeclass, which is now the parent class of ``Fractional``. The ``Int`` instance of ``Fractional`` is discontinued, but there is an ``Int`` instance of ``Divisible``. This change will break projects that rely on the ``Fractional Int`` instance. To fix that, change the code to rely on ``Divisible Int`` instead. This change will also break projects where a ``Fractional`` instance is defined. To fix that, add a ``Divisible`` instance and move the definition of ``(/)`` there.

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The HTTP JSON API is now integrated with the
  assistant and distributed with the SDK. It can either be launched
  via ``daml json-api`` or via ``daml start``. You can find more information in the
  `README <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/ledger-service/http-json/README.md>`_.
- The `daml.yaml` file now supports an additional field
  `build-options`, which you can use to list cli options you want added to
  invocations of `daml build` and `daml ide`.

JSON API
~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The ``/contracts/search`` request payload must use
  ``"%templates"`` in place of ``"templateIds"`` to select which templates' contracts are
  returned.  See `issue #2777 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2777>`_.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Move the DAML-LF produced by generic template instantiations closer to the surface syntax. See the documentation on `How DAML types are translated to DAML-LF <https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/daml-lf-translation.html#template-types>`__ for details.

.. _release-0-13-22:

0.13.22 - 2019-09-04
--------------------

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Changed the meaning of the ``source`` field in the daml.yaml
  file to be a pointer to the source directory of the DAML code contained in a project relative to
  the project root. This is breaking projects, where the ``source`` field of the project is pointing
  to a non-toplevel location in the source code directory structure.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduced initial support for multi-node testing. Note that for the time
  being no test actually uses more than one node.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The ``-p`` / ``--target-port`` and ``-h`` / ``--host``
  flags have been discontinued. Pass one (or more) endpoints to test as command line arguments in the
  ``<host>:<port>`` form.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Basic explanation of generic templates.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** In Protobuf ``Value`` message, rename ``decimal` field to ``numeric``.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Updated the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to version 42.2.6.
- Added TRACE level debugging for database operations.
- Fixed a bug that could lead to an inconsistent snapshot of active contracts being served
  by the ActiveContractsService under high load.
- Commands are now deduplicated based on ``(submitter, application_id, command_id)``.

.. _release-0-13-21:

0.13.21 - 2019-08-29
--------------------

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Enable the language extension ``FlexibleContexts`` by default.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Enable the language extension ``MonoLocalBinds`` by default. ``let`` and ``where`` bindings introducing polymorphic functions that are used at different types now need an explicit type annotation. Without the type annotation the type of the first use site will be inferred and use sites at different types will fail with a type mismatch error.

Java Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix bug that caused the generation of duplicate methods that affected sources with data constructors with type parameters that are either non-unique or not presented in the same order as in the corresponding data type declaration. See `#2367 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2367>`__.

Ledger
~~~~~~

- H2 Database support in the Ledger API Server.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- The sandbox now properly sets the connection pool properties ``minimumIdle``, ``maximumPoolSize``, and ``connectionTimeout``.

.. _release-0-13-20:

0.13.20 - 2019-08-22
--------------------

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added platform-independent tips for testing

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Some issues that caused ``damlc test`` to crash on shutdown have been fixed.
- The DAML compiler was accidentally compiled without
  optimizations on Windows. This has been fixed which should improve
  the performance of ``damlc`` and ``daml studio`` on Windows.
- ``damlc build`` should no longer leak file handles so
  ``ulimit`` workarounds should no longer be necessary.
- Allow more contexts in generic templates. Specifically, template constraints can
  have arguments besides type variables, if the FlexibleContexts extension is enabled.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- **Breaking** Rename ``NUMERIC`` back to ``DECIMAL`` in Protobuf definition.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``damlc ide`` now also accepts ``--ghc-option`` arguments like ``damlc build``
  so ``damlc ide --ghc-option -W`` launches the IDE with more warnings.
- The VSCode extension now has a configuration field for
  passing extra arguments to ``damlc ide``.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Participant State API and kvutils was extended with support for
  changing the ledger configuration. See changelog in respective ``package.scala`` files.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug that caused the reset service to hang for 10 seconds. See issue `#2549 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2549>`__.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Java Codegen now supports parametrized ContractIds.
  See `#2258 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2258>`__.

DAML Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``stripInfix`` function to ``DA.List``.

.. _release-0-13-19:

0.13.19 - 2019-08-14
--------------------

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug that prevented the ledger from loading transactions with empty workflow ids.
- Fixed internal shutdown order to avoid dead letter warnings when
  stopping Sandbox/Ledger API Server.  See issue `#1886
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1886>`__.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new command for visualizing a project in the IDE.
- Print stack trace when a scenario fails.
- Various memory leaks have been fixed so long-running sessions should
  no longer show a significant increase in memory usage.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``--project-root`` option now works properly with relative paths
  in ``daml build``.
- Support generic template declarations and instances. Documentation
  for generic templates is still being worked on.
- The ``--dump-pom`` flag from ``damlc package`` has been removed as
  packaging has not relied on POM files for a while.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- ``{"None": {}}`` and ``{"Some": value}``, where previously accepted, are no longer supported or used for DAML ``Optional`` values.
  Instead, for simple cases, use the plain value for ``Some``, and ``null`` for ``None``.
  See issue `#2361 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2361>`__ for other cases.

HTTP JSON API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A new, more intuitive JSON format for DAML values is supported.
  See issue `#2361 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2361>`__.


.. _release-0-13-18:

0.13.18 - 2019-08-07
--------------------

- Fix a bug where ``daml studio`` did not launch VSCode on Windows.

.. _release-0-13-17:

0.13.17 - 2019-08-07
--------------------

DAML Docs
~~~~~~~~~

- For ``damlc docs``, the ``--template`` argument now takes the path
  to a Mustache template when generating Markdown, Rst, and HTML
  output. The template can use ``title`` and ``body`` variables to
  control the appearance of the docs.

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Spaces in user names or other parts of file names should now be handled correctly.
- The ``daml deploy`` and ``daml ledger`` experimental commands were
  added. Use ``daml deploy --help`` and ``daml ledger --help`` to find
  out more about them.

.. _release-0-13-16:

0.13.16 - 2019-08-01
--------------------

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Handwritten instances of ``Template`` and ``Choice``
  typeclasses are no longer supported. All template constructs must be defined
  using declarations inside ``template`` syntax.

DAML Docs
~~~~~~~~~

- The ``damlc docs`` command now produces docs to a folder by default. Use the
  new ``--combine`` flag to output a single file instead.
- The ``damlc docs`` flag ``--prefix`` has been replaced with a ``--template``
  flag which allows for a more flexible template.
- The ``damlc docs`` flag ``--json`` has been dropped in favor of
  ``--format=json``.

Extractor
~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Changed schema to accomodate removed field
  ``ExercisedEvent#contract_creating_event_id``. Existing database schemas are
  not compatible anymore with the newer version. The extractor needs to be run
  on an empty schema from Ledger Begin.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add all packages of java bindings to the javadocs. See `#2280
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2280>`__.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed field
  ``ExercisedEvent#contract_creating_event_id``.  See `#2068
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2068>`__.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed field
  ``ExercisedEvent#contract_creating_event_id``.  See `#2068
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2068>`__.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- The active contract service correctly serves stakeholders. See `#2070
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2070>`__.
- Added the ``--maxInboundMessageSize`` CLI parameter to set the maximux size
  of messages received through the Ledger API. If the value is not set the
  current default is preserved (4 MB).
- Makes package uploads idempotent and tolerate partial duplicates. See `#2130
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2130>`__.

.. _release-0-13-15:

0.13.15 - 2019-07-25
--------------------

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Scenario links no longer disappear if the
  current file does not compile. The location is adjusted but this is done
  one a best effort basis and can fail if the scenario itself is modified.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support reading of DAML-LF 1.5 again.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- **Breaking** Rename ``DECIMAL`` by ``NUMERIC`` in archive Protobuf definition.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING**: Drop support for legacy identifier. The
  previously deprecated field ``name`` in ``Identifier`` message is not
  supported anymore. Use ``module_name`` and ``entity_name`` instead.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an issue when Navigator console did not see any contracts.
  See `#2271 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2271>`__.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the Maven pom.xml file for ``quickstart-java`` to better integrate with VS Code.
  See `#887 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/887>`__.

Releases
~~~~~~~~

- Releases should now be announced on `the releases blog <https://blog.daml.com/release-notes>`__.

.. _release-0-13-14:

0.13.14 - 2019-07-22
--------------------

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support reading of DAML-LF 1.5 again.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

VSCode scenario view improvements. Add a note in the IDE if:

- there is an open scenario view for a scenario that does no longer exist,
- there is an open scenario view for a scenario in a file that does no longer compile.

.. _release-0-13-13:

0.13.13 - 2019-07-16
--------------------

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix VSCode path for use if not already in PATH on mac
- **BREAKING**: remove `--replace=newer` option.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix a bug where the extension seemed to disappear every other
  time VS Code was opened.
- DAML Studio now displays a “Processing” indicator on the bottom
  left while the IDE is doing work in the background.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixing an issue around handling passTime in scenario loader
  See `#1953 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1953>`__.
- Remembering already loaded packages after reset
  See `#1979 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1979>`__.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Release version 1.6. This versions provides:

  + ``enum`` types. See `issue #105
    <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/105>`__ and `DAML-LF 1
    specification <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/daml-lf/spec/daml-lf-1.rst>`__
    for more details.

  + new builtins for (un)packing strings. See `issue #16
    <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/16>`__.

  + intern package IDs. See `issue #1614
    <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1614>`__.


DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for DAML-LF ``1.6``. In particular:

  + **BREAKING CHANGE** Add support for ``enum`` types. DAML variant types
    that look like enumerations (i.e., those variants without type parameters
    and without arguments) are compiled to the new DAML-LF ``enum`` type when
    DAML-LF 1.6 target is selected. For instance the daml type declaration of
    the form::

      data Color = Red | Green | Blue

    will produce a DAML-LF ``enum`` type instead of DAML-LF ``variant`` type.
    This change is breaking, since this release makes DAML-LF ``1.6`` the
    default compiler output.

  + Add ``DA.Text.toCodePoints`` and ``DA.Text.fromCodePoints`` primitives to
    (un)pack strings.

  + Add support for DAML-LF intern package IDs.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Make DAML-LF 1.6 the default output.
  This change activates the support of ``enum`` type describes above.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Drop support for DAML-LF 1.5. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.6
  requires some changes regarding enum types to applications using the Ledger
  API, see above. (The ledger server still supports DAML-LF 1.5.)

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for ``enum`` types. Simple DAML ``variant`` types
  will be mapped to DAML-LF ``enum`` types when using a DAML-LF ``1.6``
  archive. Ledger API Value Protobuf provides the new ``Enum`` message.
  This message must be used to communicate this new data type throught the
  API.

Java Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for ``enum`` types. ``enum`` types are mapped to
  standard java enum. See `Generate Java code from DAML
  <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/docs/source/app-dev/bindings-java/codegen.rst>`__
  for more details.

Scala Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for ``enum`` types.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for ``enum`` types.

Extractor
~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for ``enum`` types.

DAML Docs
~~~~~~~~~

- Added links to type signatures in generated docs. Check out the updated
  `standard library docs <https://docs.daml.com/daml/reference/base.html>`__.

.. _release-0-13-12:

0.13.12 - 2019-07-09
--------------------

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix VSCode path for use if not already in PATH on mac.
- Kill child processes on ``SIGTERM``. This means that killing
  ``daml sandbox`` will also kill the sandbox process.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~
- Fixed regression that produced an invalid daml-lf-archive artefact.
  See `#2058 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2058>`__.

DAML Docs
~~~~~~~~~
- **BREAKING CHANGE** ``damlc docs`` now typechecks the source files before doc generation, to be able to use type information during doc generation. This may break existing doc builds.
- Added ``--package-name`` and ``--input-format`` flags to ``damlc docs``.


.. _release-0-13-11:

0.13.11 - 2019-07-08
--------------------

Sandbox
~~~~~~~
- The completion stream method of the command completion service uses the ledger end as a default value for the offset. See `#1913 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1913>`__.
- Fixed an issue when CompletionService returns offsets having inclusive semantics when used for re-subscription.
  See `#1932 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1932>`__.
- DAML-LF packages used by the sandbox are now stored in Postgres,
  allowing users to resume a Postgres sandbox ledger without having to again
  specify all packages through the CLI.
  See `#1929 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1929>`__.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added overloads to the Java bindings ``CompletionStreamRequest`` constructor and the ``CommandCompletionClient`` to accept a request without an explicit ledger offset. See `#1913 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1913>`__.
- **DEPRECATION**: the ``CompletionStreamRequest#getOffset`` method is deprecated in favor of the non-nullable ``CompletionStreamRequest#getLedgerOffset``. See `#1913 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1913>`__.

Scala Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contract keys are exposed on CreatedEvent. See `#1681 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1681>`__.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~
- Contract keys are show in the contract details page. See `#1681 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1681>`__.

DAML Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove the deprecated modules ``DA.Map``, ``DA.Set``, ``DA.Experimental.Map`` and ``DA.Experimental.Set``. Please use ``DA.Next.Map`` and ``DA.Next.Set`` instead.
- Add ``Sum`` and ``Product`` newtypes that
  provide ``Monoid`` instances based on the ``Additive`` and ``Multiplicative``
  instances of the underlying type.
- Add ``Min`` and ``Max`` newtypes that
  provide ``Semigroup`` instances based ``min`` and ``max``.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The default output path for all artifacts is now in the ``.daml`` directory.
  In particular, the default output path for .dar files in ``daml build`` is now
  ``.daml/dist/<projectname>.dar``.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~
- DAML Studio is now published as an extension in the Visual Studio Code
  marketplace. The ``daml studio`` command will now install the published extension by
  default, but will revert to the extension bundled with the DAML SDK if installation
  fails. You can get the old default behavior of always using the bundled extension
  by running ``daml studio --replace=newer`` or ``daml studio --replace=always`` instead.
- You can now configure the gRPC message size limit in
  ``daml.yaml`` via ``scenario-service: {"grpc-max-message-size": 1000000}``.
  This will set the limit to 1000000 bytes. This should
  only be necessary for very large projects.
- You can now configure the gRPC timeout
  ``daml.yaml`` via ``scenario-service: {"grpc-timeout": 42}``.
  This option will set the timeout to 42 seconds. You should
  only need to set this option for very large projects.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Make DivulgenceIT properly work when run via the Ledger API Test Tool.
- The submission service shuts down its ExecutorService upon exit to ensure a smooth shutdown.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~
- The DAML-LF development version (``1.dev``) includes a new, breaking restriction
  regarding contract key lookups. In short, when looking up or fetching a key,
  the transaction submitter must be one of the key maintainers.
  Note that this change is not breaking since the compiler does not produce DAML-LF
  ``1.dev`` by default. However it will be a breaking change once this restriction
  makes it into DAML-LF ``1.6`` and once DAML-LF ``1.6`` becomes the default.


.. _release-0-13-10:

0.13.10 - 2019-06-28
--------------------

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Added `--log-level` command line flag.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The Sandbox no longer supports loading from DALF files. You can now only use DAR files. See `#1610 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1610>`__.


Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added new CLI flags ``--stable-party-identifiers`` and
  ``--stable-command-identifiers`` to the :doc:`Ledger API Test Tool
  </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>` to allow disabling randomization of party
  and command identifiers. It is useful for testing of ledgers which are
  configured with a predefined static set of parties.


.. _release-0-13-9:

0.13.9 - 2019-06-28
-------------------

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix an error in the ``package.json`` that stopped the extension from being loaded.

.. _release-0-13-8:

0.13.8 - 2019-06-27
-------------------

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- Contract details now show signatories and observers.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.

Scala Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reflect addition of signatories and observers to the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.

Java Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Generated code supports signatories and observers as exposed by the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reflect addition of signatories and observers to the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Expose signatories and observers for a contract in ``CreatedEvent``.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Specify pretty C# namespaces in ledger api protos. C# bindings will end up in a different namespace than the default one.
  See `#1901 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1901>`__.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Drop support for DAML-LF 1.4. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.5 should work without any code changes, although we highly recommend not specifying a target DAML-LF version at all. (The ledger server still supports DAML-LF 1.4.)

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Made the archive CLI arguments optional.
  See `#1905 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1905>`__.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Specify pretty C# namespaces in archive protos. C# bindings will end up in a different namespace than the default one.
  See `#1900 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1900>`__.

.. _release-0-13-7:

0.13.7 - 2019-06-26
-------------------

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Rename ``none`` and ``some`` to ``optional_none`` and ``optional_some``, resp., in ``Expr`` and ``CasePat``.

.. _release-0-13-6:

0.13.6 - 2019-06-25
-------------------

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``--install-assistant`` flag to ``daml install`` command,
  changing the default behavior of ``daml install`` to install the assistant
  whenever we are installing a newer version of the SDK. Deprecated the
  ``--activate`` flag.
- Added ``--start-navigator``, ``--on-start``, and ``--wait-for-signal``
  options to ``daml start``, to make scripting and testing with the sandbox much easier.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Opening an already open scenario will now focus it rather than opening
  it in a new empty tab which is never updated with results.
- The selected view for scenario results (table or transaction) is now
  preserved when the scenario results are updated.
  See `#1675 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1675>`__.
- Goto definition now works on the export list of modules.
- Goto definition now works on types.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Rename ``TO_TEXT_CODE_POINTS`` and ``FROM_TEXT_CODE_POINTS`` to ``TEXT_FROM_CODE_POINTS`` and ``TEXT_TO_CODE_POINTS``, resp.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Protobuf has been upgraded to version 3.8.0. This
  also includes the protobuf-java library used as a dependency.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added additional Ledger API integration tests to Ledger API Test Tool.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The artefact ``com.daml.ledger:bindings-java`` now has ``grpc-netty`` as dependency so that users don't need to explicitly add it.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in the test tool that prevented users from running the tests.
  See `#1841 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1841>`__

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for SDK project configuration files. If you start Navigator with the SDK Assistant,
  Navigator will directly read the ``daml.yaml`` config file instead of the old Navigator config file.
  See `#1128 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1128>`__.

Docker Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The daml-sdk docker images are now based on Alpine Linux.

.. _release-0-13-5:

0.13.5 - 2019-06-19
-------------------

Release Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to the CI/CD release procedure.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Introduced a new API for package management.
  See `#1311 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1311>`__.

.. _release-0-13-4:

0.13.4 - 2019-06-19
-------------------

Java Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support generic types (including tuples) as contract keys in codegen.
  See `#1728 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1728>`__.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- A new command ``ExerciseByKey`` allows to exercise choices on active contracts referring to them by their key.
  See `#1366 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1366>`__.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The addition of the ``ExerciseByKey`` to the Ledger API is reflected in the bindings.
  See `#1366 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1366>`__.

Release Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to the release procedure. Note: The release to Maven Central was successfully
  performed _manually_ in release 0.13.3. This release should confirm that it will occur
  as part of the CI/CD.
  See `#1745 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1745>`__

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Closing and reopening scenario results will now show the results
  instead of an empty view.
  See `#1606 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1606>`__.

.. _release-0-13-3:

0.13.3 - 2019-06-18
-------------------

Release Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to the release procedure.
  See `#1737 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1737>`__

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The changes for Java Bindings listed for SDK 0.13.2 now only apply to SDK 0.13.3 and later.
  This is due to the partial failure of the release procedure.

Docs
~~~~

- Added :doc:`/daml/intro/0_Intro`

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The IDE now executes tasks in parallel.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in migration scripts that could cause databases originally created
  with older versions of the Sandbox to not upgrade schemas properly.
  See `#1682 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1682>`__.

.. _release-0-13-2:

0.13.2 - 2019-06-18
-------------------

Visualizing DAML Contracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added :doc:`Visualizing DAML Contracts </tools/visual>`

Release Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to the release procedure.
  See `#1725 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1725>`__

- The changes for Java Bindings listed for SDK 0.13.1 now only apply to SDK 0.13.2 and later.
  This is due to the partial failure of the release procedure.

.. _release-0-13-1:

0.13.1 - 2019-06-17
-------------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Add an instance for ``IsParties (Optional Party)``, allowing ``Optional`` values to be used in ``signatory``, ``observer`` and ``maintainer`` clauses.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Release the Java Bindings to the public Maven Central repository. To move to using the Maven Central repository, remove
  the ``<repository>...</repository>`` and ``<pluginRepository>...</pluginRepository>`` blocks from Maven POM files
  that use version 0.13.1 (or later) of the Java Bindings.
  See `#1205 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1205>`__.

.. _release-0-13-0:

0.13.0 - 2019-06-17
-------------------

SDK
~~~

- This marks the first release that is no longer released for the
  ``da`` assistant. It is still possible to use it to get older SDK
  releases. Take a look at `documentation
  <https://docs.daml.com/tools/assistant.html>`__ for the new ``daml``
  assistant for migration instructions.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in an internal data structure that broke contract keys.
  See `#1623 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1623>`__.
- Fixed a bug of not closing a resource properly when shutting down the Sandbox.
  See `#1702 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1702>`__.

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Double the gRPC message limit used for the scenario service. This
  avoids issues on large projects.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Slash (/) is now an allowed character in contract, workflow, application
  and command identifiers.

.. _release-0-12-25:

0.12.25 — 2019-06-13
--------------------

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added new CLI flag ``--all-tests`` to the :doc:`Ledger API Test Tool
  </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>` to run all default and optional tests.
- Added new CLI flag ``--command-submission-ttl-scale-factor`` to the
  :doc:`Ledger API Test Tool </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>`. It scales
  time-to-live of commands sent for ledger processing (captured as Maximum Record
  Time in submitted transactions) for some suites. Useful to tune Maximum Record
  Time depending on the environment and the Ledger implementation under test.
- Fixed various bugs in the daml-on-x ledger api server and index service.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Introduced a new API for party management.
  See `#1312 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1312>`__.

Scala bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New `--root` command-line option for limiting what templates are selected for codegen.
  See `#1210 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1210>`__.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- Contract keys are now available for created events from the transaction service.
  See `#1268 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1268>`__.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The addition of contract keys on created events in the Ledger API is reflected in the bindings.
  See `#1268 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1268>`__.

Java Codegen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Contracts decoded from the transaction service now expose their contract key (if defined).
  See `#1268 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1268>`__.

.. _release-0-12-24:

0.12.24 - 2019-06-06
--------------------

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix errors due to unhandled ``$/cancelRequest`` and ``textDocument/willSave``
  requests from showing up in the output tab in VSCode. These errors also caused
  an automatic switch from the problems tab to the output tab which should now
  no longer happen.

- Note that upgrading the VSCode extension requires launching it via
  ``daml studio``. If you launch VSCode directly, you might get issues
  due to an outdated extension.

.. _release-0-12-23:

0.12.23 - 2019-06-05
--------------------

SQL Extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 50MiB is no longer hard-coded on extractor input for sandbox or any other server,
  permitting large packages; e.g. pass ``--ledger-api-inbound-message-size-max 62914560``
  to extractor to get a 60MiB limit.
  See `#1520 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1520>`__.
- Improving logging. See `#1518 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1518>`__.

DAML Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Contract key maintainers must now explicitly be computed from the contract key using the implicit ``key`` variable. For instance, if you have ``key (bank, accountId) : (Party, Text)`` and want ``bank`` to be the maintainer, you have to write ``maintainer key._1`` (before, you could write ``maintainer bank``).

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Drop support for DAML-LF 1.3. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.4 should work without any code changes, although we highly recommend not specifying a target DAML-LF version at all. (The ledger server still supports DAML-LF 1.3.)

- Fix initialization of package-db for non-default DAML-LF versions.
  This fixes issues when using "daml build --target 1.3" (or other target versions).

DAML Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``enumerate`` function.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a regression where Navigator console was not able to inspect contracts and events.
  See `#1454 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1454>`__.
- 50MiB is no longer hard-coded on extractor input for sandbox or any other server,
  permitting large packages; e.g. pass ``--ledger-api-inbound-message-size-max 62914560``
  to extractor to get a 60MiB limit.
  See `#1520 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1520>`__.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Added recovery around failing ledger entry persistence queries using Postgres. See `#1505 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1505>`__.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The :doc:`Ledger API Test Tool </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>` can now optionally run ``TransactionServiceIT`` as part of the conformance tests.
  This means you need to load additional ``.dar`` files into the ledger under test. Please refer to the updated instructions in the :doc:`documentation </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>`.
- Added new CLI options to the :doc:`Ledger API Test Tool </tools/ledger-api-test-tool/index>`:

  - ``--list`` prints all available tests to the console
  - ``--include`` takes a comma-separated list of test names that should be run
  - ``--exclude`` takes a comma-separated list of test names that should not be run

0.12.22 - 2019-05-29
--------------------

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where type check errors would persist if there was a subsequent parse error.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Drop support for DAML-LF 1.2. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.3 should work without any code changes, although we highly recommend not specifying a target DAML-LF version at all.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: By default ``damlc test`` must be executed in a project and will test the whole project. Testing individual files, potentially outside a project, requires passing the new ``--files`` flag.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- The Syntax of party literals is relaxed by allowing the character colon. Concretely those literals must match the
  regular expression ``[a-zA-Z0-9:\-_ ]+`` instead of ``[a-zA-Z0-9\-_ ]+`` previously.
  See `#1467 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1467>`__.

SQL Extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The extractor ``--party`` option may now specify multiple parties, separated by commas;
  e.g. instead of ``--party Bob`` you can say ``--party Bob,Bar,Baz`` and get the contracts
  for all three parties in the database.
  See `#1360 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1360>`__.

- The extractor ``--templates`` option to specify template IDs in the format:
  ``<module1>:<entity1>,<module2>:<entity2>``. If not provided, extractor subscribes to all available templates.
  See `#1352 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1352>`__.

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in the SQL backend that caused transactions with a fetch node referencing a contract created in the same transaction to be rejected.
  See `issue #1435 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1435>`__.

0.12.21 - 2019-05-28
--------------------

DAML Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``exposed-modules`` field in ``daml.yaml`` is now optional. If it is
  not specified, all modules in the project are exposed.
  See `#1328 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1328>`_.

- You can now see all available versions with ``daml version`` using the ``--all`` flag.

DAML Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Drop support for DAML-LF 1.1. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.2 should work without any code changes, although we highly recommend not specifying a target DAML-LF version at all.

- Make DAML-LF 1.5 the default version produced by the compiler.

DAML Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``parseInt`` and ``parseDecimal`` now work at more extremes of values and accept leading plus signs.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Add new version 1.5. See `DAML-LF 1 specification <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/daml-lf/spec/daml-lf-1.rst#version-1-5>`_ for details.

Ledger
~~~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The string fields ``application_id``, ``command_id``, ``ledger_id``, and ``workflow_id``
  in Ledger API commands must now match the regular expression  ``[A-Za-z0-9\._:\-#]{1,255}``. Those fields
  were unrestricted UTF-8 strings in previous versions.
  See `#398 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/398>`__.

0.12.20 - 2019-05-23
--------------------

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- **Contract keys**: Support arbitrary key expressions (this was accidentally omitted from 0.12.19).

0.12.19 - 2019-05-22
--------------------

Ledger
~~~~~~

- Transaction filters in `GetTransactionsRequest` without any party are now rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of yielding an empty stream

  See `#1250 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1250>`__ for details.

DAML
~~~~

- **Contract keys**: The syntactic restriction on contract keys has been removed. They can be arbitray expressions now.

DAML-LF
~~~~~~~

- Add new version 1.4 and make it the default version produced by ``damlc``. It removes the syntactic restriction on contract keys.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Bots**: A class called LedgerTestView was added to make bot unit testing possible

DAML
~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE - Syntax**: Records with empty update blocks, e.g. ``foo with``, is now an error (the fact it was ever accepted was a bug).

- **BREAKING CHANGE - Contract Keys**: Before, maintainers were incorrectly not checked to be a subset of the signatories, now they are. See `issue #1123 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1123>`__

Sandbox
~~~~~~~

- When loading a scenario with ``--scenario``, the sandbox no longer compiles packages twice, see
  `issue #1238 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1238>`__.
- When starting the sandbox, you can now choose to have it load all the ``.dar`` packages immediately
  with the ``--eager-package-loading`` flag. The default behavior is to load the packages only when
  a command requires them, which causes a delay for the first command that requires a yet-to-be-compiled
  package.
  See `issue #1230 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1230>`__.

SDK tools
~~~~~~~~~

- The Windows installer is now signed. You might still see Windows
  defender warnings for some time but the publisher should now show
  "Digital Asset Holdings, LLC".

.. _release-0-12-18:

0.12.18 - 2019-05-20
--------------------

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed unnecessary dependency in the quickstart-java example project.
- Removed the *Configure Maven* section from the installation instructions. This step is not needed anymore.

SDK tools
~~~~~~~~~

- **DAML Assistant**: We've built a new and improved version of the SDK assistant, replacing ``da`` commands with ``daml`` commands. The documentation is updated to use the new assistant in this release.

  For a full guide to what's changed and how to migrate, see :doc:`/support/new-assistant`. To read about how to use the new ``daml`` Assistant, see :doc:`/tools/assistant`.

DAML
~~~~

- **BREAKING CHANGE - DAML Compiler**: It is now an error to omit method bodies in class ``instance`` s if the method
  has no default. Almost all instances of such behaviour were an error - add in a suitable definition.

- **Contract keys**: We've added documentation for contract keys, a way of specifying a primary key for contract instances. For information about how to use them, see :doc:`/daml/reference/contract-keys`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE - DAML Standard Library**: Moved the ``Tuple`` and ``Either`` types to ``daml-prim:DA.Types``
  rather than exposing internal locations.

  How to migrate:

  - You don't need to change DAML code as a result of this change.
  - People using the Java/Scala codegen need to replace ``import ghc.tuple.*`` or ``import da.internal.prelude.*`` with ``import da.types.*``.
  - People using the Ledger API directly need to replace ``GHC.Tuple`` and ``DA.Internal.Prelude`` with ``DA.Types``.

- **BREAKING CHANGE - DAML Standard Library**: Don't expose the ``TextMap`` type via the ``Prelude`` anymore.

  How to migrate: Always import ``DA.TextMap`` when you want to use the ``TextMap`` type.

- **DAML Standard Library**: Add ``String`` as a compatibility alias for ``Text``.

Ledger API
~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING** Removed the unused field :ref:`com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.ExercisedEvent` from :ref:`com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.Event`,
  because a :ref:`com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.Transaction` never contains exercised events (only created and archived events): `#960 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/960>`_

  This change is *backwards compatible on the transport level*, meaning:

  - new versions of ledger language bindings will work with previous versions of the Sandbox, because the field was never populated
  - previous versions of the ledger language bindings will work with new versions of the Sandbox, as the field was removed without any change in observable behavior

  How to migrate:

  - If you check for the presence of :ref:`com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.ExercisedEvent` when handling a :ref:`com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.Transaction`, you have to remove this code now.

- Added the :ref:`agreement text <daml-ref-agreements>` as a new field ``agreement_text`` to the ``CreatedEvent`` message. This means you now have access to the agreement text of contracts via the Ledger API.
  The type of this field is ``google.protobuf.StringValue`` to properly reflect the optionality on the wire for full backwards compatibility.
  See Google's `wrappers.proto <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/b4f193788c9f0f05d7e0879ea96cd738630e5d51/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto#L31-L34>`__ for more information about ``StringValue``.

  See `#1110 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1110>`__ for details.

- Fixed: the `CommandService.SubmitAndWait` endpoint no longer rejects commands without a workflow identifier.

  See `#572 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/572>`__ for details.

Java Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING** Reflect the breaking change of Ledger API in the event class hierarchy:

  - Changed ``data.Event`` from an abstract class to an interface, representing events in a flat transaction.
  - Added interface ``data.TreeEvent``, representing events in a transaction tree.
  - ``data.CreatedEvent`` and ``data.ArchivedEvent`` now implement ``data.Event``.
  - ``data.CreatedEvent`` and ``data.ExercisedEvent`` now implement ``data.TreeEvent``.
  - ``data.TransactionTree#eventsById`` is now ``Map<String, TreeEvent>`` (was previously ``Map<String, Event>``).

  How to migrate:

  - If you are processing ``data.TransactionTree`` objects, you need to change the type of the processed events from ``data.Event`` to ``data.TreeEvent``.
  - If you are checking for the presense of exercised events when processing ``data.Transaction`` objects, you can remove that code now.
    It would never have triggered in the first place, as transactions do not contain exercised events.

- **Java Codegen**: You can now call a method to get a ``CreateAndExerciseCommand`` for each choice, for example:

  .. code-block:: java

     CreateAndExerciseCommand cmd = new MyTemplate(owner, someText).createAndExerciseAccept(42L);

  In this case ``MyTemplate`` is a DAML template with a choice ``Accept`` and the resulting command will create a contract and exercise the ``Accept`` choice within the same transaction.

  See `issue #1092 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1092>`__ for details.

- Added :ref:`agreement text <daml-ref-agreements>` of contracts: `#1110 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1110>`__

  - **Java Bindings**

    - Added field ``Optional<String> agreementText`` to ``data.CreatedEvent``, to reflect the change in Ledger API.

  - **Java Codegen**

    - Added generated field ``Optional<String> TemplateName.Contract#agreementText``.
    - Added generated static method ``TemplateName.Contract.fromCreatedEvent(CreatedEvent)``.
      This is the preferred method to use for converting a ``CreatedEvent`` into a ``Contract``.
    - Added generated static method ``TemplateName.Contract.fromIdAndRecord(String, Record, Optional<String>)``.
      This method is useful for setting up tests, when you want to convert a ``Record`` into a contract without having to create a ``CreatedEvent`` first.
    - Deprecated generated static method ``TemplateName.Contract.fromIdAndRecord(String, Record)`` in favor of the new static methods in the generated ``Contract`` classes.
    - Changed the generated :ref:`decoder utility class <daml-codegen-java-decoder-class>` to use the new ``fromCreatedEvent`` method.
    - **BREAKING** Changed the return type of the ``getDecoder`` method in the generated decoder utility class from ``Optional<BiFunction<String, Record, Contract>>`` to ``Optional<Function<CreatedEvent, Contract>>``.

  How to migrate:

  - If you are manually constructing instances of ``data.CreatedEvent`` (for example, for testing), you need to add an ``Optional<String>`` value as constructor parameter for the ``agreementText`` field.
  - You should change all calls to ``Contract.fromIdAndRecord`` to ``Contract.fromCreatedEvent``.

    .. code-block:: java

        // BEFORE
        CreatedEvent event = ...;
        Iou.Contract contract = Iou.Contract.fromIdAndRecord(event.getContractId(), event.getArguments()));

        // AFTER
        CreatedEvent event = ...;
        Iou.Contract contract = Iou.Contract.fromCreatedEvent(event);

  - Pass the ``data.CreatedEvent`` directly to the function returned by the decoder's ``getDecoder`` method.
    If you are using the decoder utility class method ``fromCreatedEvent``, you don't need to change anything.

    .. code-block:: java

        CreatedEvent event = ...;
        // BEFORE
        Optional<BiFunction<String, Record, Contract>> decoder = MyDecoderUtility.getDecoder(MyTemplate.TEMPLATE_ID);
        if (decoder.isPresent()) {
            return decoder.get().apply(event.getContractId(), event.getArguments();
        }

        // AFTER
        Optional<Function<CreatedEvent, Contract>> decoder = MyDecoderUtility.getDecoder(MyTemplate.TEMPLATE_ID);
        if (decoder.isPresent()) {
            return decoder.get().apply(event);
        }

Scala Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING** You can now access the :ref:`agreement text <daml-ref-agreements>` of a contract with the new field ``Contract#agreementText: Option[String]``.

  How to migrate:

  - If you are pattern matching on ``com.digitalasset.ledger.client.binding.Contract``, you need to add a match clause for the added field.
  - If you are constructing ``com.digitalasset.ledger.client.binding.Contract`` values, for example for tests, you need to add a constructor parameter for the agreement text.

- ``CreateAndExercise`` support via ``createAnd`` method, e.g. ``MyTemplate(owner, someText).createAnd.exerciseAccept(controller, 42)``.
  See `issue #1092 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1092>`__ for more information.

Ledger
~~~~~~

- Renamed ``--jdbcurl`` to ``--sql-backend-jdbcurl``. Left ``--jdbcurl`` in place for backwards compat.
- Fixed issue when loading scenarios making use of ``pass`` into the sandbox, see
  `#1079 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/1079>`_.
- Fixed issue when loading scenarios that involve contract divulgence, see
  `#1166 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1166>`_.
- Contract visibility is now properly checked when looking up contracts in the SQL backend, see
  `#784 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/784>`_.
- The sandbox now exposes the :ref:`agreement text <daml-ref-agreements>` of contracts in :ref:`CreatedEvents <com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.CreatedEvent>`. See `#1110 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1110>`__

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

- Non-empty :ref:`agreement texts <daml-ref-agreements>` are now shown on the contract page above the section ``Contract details``, see `#1110 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1110>`__

SQL Extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING** In JSON content, dates and timestamps are formatted like
  ``"2020-02-22"`` and ``"2020-02-22T12:13:14Z"`` rather than UNIX epoch offsets like
  ``18314`` or ``1582373594000000``. See `#1174 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1174>`__
  for more details.

.. _release-0-12-17:

0.12.17 - 2019-05-10
--------------------

- Making transaction lookups performant so we can handle such requests for large ledgers as well

- **Sandbox**: Transactions with a record time that is after the maximum record time (as provided in the original command) are now properly rejected instead of committed to the ledger.

  See `issue #987 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/987>`__ for details.

- **SDK**: The Windows installer no longer requires elevated privileges.

.. _release-0-12-16:

.. _release-0-12-15:

0.12.15 - 2019-05-06
--------------------

- **Windows support**: Beta release of the Windows SDK.

  To try it out, download the installer from `GitHub releases <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases>`__. The Windows SDK uses the new ``daml`` command-line which will soon also
  become the default on Linux and MacOS.

  Documentation is still in progress, but you can see the :doc:`Migration guide </support/new-assistant>` and the `pull request for the updated documentation <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/740>`__.
- **DAML Standard Library**: Added ``fromListWith`` and ``merge`` to ``DA.TextMap``.
- **DAML Standard Library**: Deprecated ``DA.Map`` and ``DA.Set``. Use the new ``DA.Next.Map`` and ``DA.Next.Set`` instead.

  - ``SubmitAndWaitForTransactionId`` returns the transaction ID.
- Beta release of the Windows SDK:
  You can download the installer from
  `GitHub releases <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases>`_.
  The Windows SDK ships with the new `daml` installer which will soon also
  become the default on Linux and MacOS. Documentation is still in progress,
  take a look at the `Migration guide <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/768>`_
  and the `updated documentation <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/740>`_.
- Add ``fromListWith`` and ``merge`` to ``DA.TextMap``.
- Release Javadoc artifacts as part of the SDK. See more `here https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/896`
- Add ``DA.Next.Map`` and ``DA.Next.Set`` and deprecate ``DA.Map`` and ``DA.Set`` in favor of those.
- Ledger API: Added three new methods to :ref:`CommandService <com.digitalasset.ledger.api.v1.commandservice>`:

  - ``SubmitAndWaitForTransactionId`` returns the transaction id.
  - ``SubmitAndWaitForTransaction`` returns the transaction.
  - ``SubmitAndWaitForTransactionTree`` returns the transaction tree.

- **Ledger API**: Added field ``transaction_id`` to command completions. This field is only set when a command is successful.
- **DAML  Standard Library**: Added instances of ``Functor``, ``Applicative``, and ``Action`` for ``(->) r`` (the reader monad).

.. _release-0-12-1:

0.12.1 — 2019-04-04
-------------------

No user-facing changes.

.. - Fix release process

.. _release-0-12-0:

0.12.0 — 2019-04-04
-------------------

- Change in how values are addressed in Navigator's ``frontend-config.js``.

  - Old syntax for accessing values: ``argument.foo.bar``
  - New syntax:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       import { DamlLfValue } from '@da/ui-core';
       // Accessing field 'bar' of field 'foo' of the argument
       DamlLfValue.evalPath(argument, ["foo", "bar"])
       DamlLfValue.toJSON(argument).foo.bar

.. _release-0-11-32:

0.11.32
-------

- **BREAKING CHANGE - DAML standard library**: Removed ``DA.List.split`` function, which was never intended to be exposed and doesn't do what the name suggests.
- **BREAKING CHANGE - Java Bindings**: Removed type parameter for ``DamlList`` and ``DamlOptional`` classes.

  The ``DamlList``, ``DamlOptional``, and ``ContractId`` classes were previously parameterized (i.e ``DamlList[String]``) for consistency with the DAML language. The type parameter has been removed as such type information is not supported by the underlying Ledger API and and therefore the parameterized type couldn’t be checked for correctness.
- **BREAKING CHANGE - Java Bindings**: For all classes in the package ``com.daml.ledger.javaapi.data``, we shortened the names of the conversion methods from long forms like ``fromProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` and ``toProtoGeneratedCompletionStreamRequest`` to the much shorter ``fromProto`` and ``toProto``.
- **Navigator**: Added support for Optional and recursive data types.
- **Navigator**: Improved start up performance for big DAML models.
- **BREAKING CHANGE - Navigator**: Refactor the GraphQL API.

  If you're maintaining a modified version of the Navigator frontend, you'll need to adapt all your GraphQL queries to the new API.
- **Navigator**: Fixed an issue where it was not possible to enter contract arguments involving contract IDs.
- **Navigator**: Fixed issues where the console could not read some events or commands from its database.
- **BREAKING CHANGE - DAML**: For the time being, data types with a single data constructor not associated with an argument are not accepted. For example, ``data T = T``.

  To work around this, use ``data T = T {}`` or ``data T = T ()`` (depending on whether you desire ``T`` be interpreted as a product or a sum).

.. _release-0-11-3:

0.11.3 - 2019-02-07
-------------------

- **Navigator**: Fixed display of Date values.
- **Extractor**: Added first version of Extractor with PostgreSQL support.

.. _release-0-11-2:

0.11.2 - 2019-01-31
-------------------

- **Navigator**: Added a terminal-based console interface using SQLite as a backend.
- **Navigator**: Now writes logs to ``./navigator.log`` by default using Logback.
- **DAML Studio**: Significant performance improvements.
- **DAML Studio**: New table view for scenario results.
- **DAML Standard Library**: New type classes.
- **Node.js bindings**: Documentation updated to use version 0.4.0 and DAML 1.2.

.. _release-0-11-1:

0.11.1 - 2019-01-24
-------------------

- **Java Bindings**: Fixed ``Timestamp.fromInstant`` and ``Timestamp.toInstant``.
- **Java Bindings**: Added ``Timestamp.getMicroseconds``.

.. _release-0-11-0:

-------------------

- **Documentation**: :doc:`DAML documentation </daml/reference/index>` and :doc:`examples </examples/examples>` now use DAML 1.2.
- **Documentation**: Added a comprehensive :doc:`quickstart guide </getting-started/quickstart>` that replaces the old "My first project" example.
