DAML SDK roadmap (as of June 2019)
==================================

This page specifies the major features weâ€™re planning to add next to the DAML SDK. Plans and timelines are subject to change. If you need any of these features or want to request others, see the :doc:`/support/support` page for how to get in touch.

We plan to update this roadmap roughly every three months.

- **Generic templates**

  Support for writing generic templates - for example, a generic ``Proposal`` workflow that could be instantiated as a ``Proposal Iou`` to propose an ``Iou``.

- **Tools to suggest improvements to DAML code**
- **Upgrading contracts**

  Improved support for the workflows of upgrading contracts that already exist on the ledger.
- **Tools for visualisation**

  Tools that allow users to visualise the static workflow and lifecycle of contracts.
- **Improve app portability between DAML ledgers**

  Add a DAML-on-X certification tool that tests that DAML ledgers implement all DAML functionality, and document a portable approach to DAML application testing.

- **JavaScript ecosystem**

  Improve the currently experimental Node.js bindings so they are stable, and add higher-level abstractions to capture recurring usage patterns.

- **DAML-on-X self-service package: Beta release**

  Make it easier for external developers to integrate DAML with other ledgers.

  You can read about the release stages on the :doc:`/daml-integration-kit/index` page.
