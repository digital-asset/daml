DAML SDK roadmap (as of June 2019)
==================================

This page specifies the major features we’re planning to add next to the DAML SDK. Plans and timelines are subject to change. If you need any of these features or want to request others, see the :doc:`/support/support` page for how to get in touch.

We plan to update this roadmap roughly every three months.

- **Generic templates**

  Support for writing generic templates - for example, a generic ``Proposal`` workflow that could be instantiated as a ``Proposal Iou`` to propose an ``Iou``.

- **Tools to suggest improvements to DAML code**
- **Upgrading contracts**

  Improved support for the workflows of upgrading contracts that already exist on the ledger.
- **Tools for visualisation**

  Tools that allow users to visualise the static workflow and lifecycle of contracts.
- **Improve app portability between DAML ledgers**

  Add a DAML-on-X certification tool that tests that DAML ledgers implement all DAML functionality, and document a portable approach to DAML application testing.

- **Ledger API authentication**

  Add Ledger API authentication for all DAML ledgers.

- **JavaScript ecosystem**

  Improve the currently experimental Node.js bindings so they are stable, and add higher-level abstractions to capture recurring usage patterns.

- **DAML-on-X self-service package: Beta release**

  Make it easier for external developers to integrate DAML with other ledgers.

  You can read about the release stages on the :doc:`/daml-integration-kit/index` page.
