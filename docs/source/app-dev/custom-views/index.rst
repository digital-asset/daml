Custom Views
############

The Custom Views library provides convenient features to continuously ingest data from a ledger into a database,
into tables of your choice, optimized for your querying requirements.

Custom Views is a Java library for **projecting** ledger events into a SQL database.
It is currently available in :doc:`Labs</support/status-definitions>` early access, and only supports PostgreSQL right now.

Use the following Maven dependency to use the Custom Views library:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.daml</groupId>
        <artifactId>custom-views_2.13</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.0</version>
    </dependency>

Please see the `Custom Views github repository <https://github.com/digital-asset/custom-views/>`_ for an example Maven project of a simple application
that projects data into a SQL table and provides access to the data through a REST interface.

Overview
********

A **Projection** is a resumable process that continuously reads ledger events and transforms these into rows in SQL tables.
A projection ensures that rows are committed according to ledger transactions,
ensuring that the isolation and atomicity of changes perceived by database users are consistent with committed transactions on the ledger.

At a high level, the following types are needed to run a projection process:

- A ``BatchSource`` connects to the ledger and reads events from it.
- A ``Projection`` defines which events to process from the ``BatchSource``, from which ``Offset`` to start processing, optionally up to an end ``Offset``.
- A ``Project`` function converts the events into database actions. A ``JdbcAction`` type defines which SQL statements should be executed.
- The ``project`` method on ``Projector`` takes a ``BatchSource``, a ``Projection``, and a ``Project`` function. The ``project`` method starts the projection process. Database transactions are committed as they occur on the ledger.

A common workflow for setting up a projection process follows:

- Create a table in your SQL database.
- Create a ``Projector``.
- Choose the type of event you want to project and create a ``BatchSource`` for it.
- Create a ``Projection``. If the projection already exists, it will continue where it left off.
- Create a ``Project`` function that transforms an event into (0 to N) database actions.
- Invoke ``project`` on the ``Projector``, passing in the ``BatchSource``, the ``Projection``, and the ``Project`` function. This starts the projection process, and returns a ``Control`` to control the process.
- Cancel the projection by invoking ``control.cancel`` on shutdown of your application.

The next sections explain the most important objects in the Custom Views library in more detail.

Projector
*********

A ``Projector`` executes the projection process. The code snippet below shows how to create a ``JdbcProjector``.

.. code-block:: java

    var config = new HikariConfig();
    config.setJdbcUrl(url);
    config.setUsername(user);
    config.setPassword(password);
    var ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
    var system = ActorSystem.create("my-projection-app");
    var projector = JdbcProjector.create(ds, system);

A ``Projector`` provides ``project`` methods to start a projection process.
A `DataSource` is used to create database connections when required. In this example a `Hikari connection pool <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP>`_ is used.
The ``project`` methods return a ``Control`` which can be used to:

- Cancel the projection.
- Find out if the projection has completed or failed.
- Wait for the projection process to close all its resources.

A projection only completes if an end ``Offset`` is set, otherwise it continuously runs and projects events as they occur on the ledger.
The ``project`` methods take a ``BatchSource``, a ``Projection`` and a ``Project`` function, which are explained in the next sections.

BatchSource
===========
A projection connects to the ledger and reads events using a ``BatchSource``, which internally uses :doc:`the Ledger API with gRPC</app-dev/grpc/index>`.
The Ledger API provides the following types of events:

- ``Event`` (``CreatedEvent`` or ``ArchivedEvent``)
- ``ExercisedEvent``
- ``TreeEvent``

The projection library uses the ``Event``, ``ExercisedEvent`` and ``TreeEvent`` classes from the :doc:`Java Bindings</app-dev/bindings-java/index>`
in the ``com.daml.ledger.javaapi.data`` package to represent these events.

The following ``BatchSource``\s are available:

- ``BatchSource.events`` creates a ``BatchSource`` that reads ``Event``\s from the ledger.
- ``BatchSource.exercisedEvents`` creates a ``BatchSource`` that reads ``ExercisedEvent``\s from the ledger.
- ``BatchSource.treeEvents`` creates a ``BatchSource`` that reads ``TreeEvent``\s from the ledger.

The example below shows how to create a ``BatchSource`` that reads ``CreatedEvent``\s and ``ArchivedEvent``\s from the ledger at ``localhost``, port ``6865``:

.. code-block:: java

    var grpcClientSettings = GrpcClientSettings.connectToServiceAt("localhost", 6865, system);
    var source = BatchSource.events(grpcClientSettings);

Additionally ``BatchSource.create`` creates a ``BatchSource`` from code-generated ``Contract`` types from ``CreateEvent``\s,
or creates a ``BatchSource`` from simple values, which is convenient for unit testing.

Batch
-----

A ``BatchSource`` reads events into ``Batch``\es. A ``Batch`` consists of 1 to many events, and optionally contains a marker that indicates that a transaction has been committed on the ledger.
`Batches` make it possible to process larger than memory transactions, while tracking transactions as they occur on the ledger, and making it possible for downstream
database transactions to only commit when these transaction markers have been detected.

Envelope
--------

The events in `Batches` are wrapped in `Envelopes`. An ``Envelope`` provides additional fields providing more context about what occurred on the ledger.
It has the following fields:

- ``event``: The wrapped value. ``getEvent`` and ``unwrap()`` both provide this value.
- ``offset``: The offset of the event.
- ``table``: The (main) ``ProjectionTable`` that is projected to.
- ``workflowId`` (optional)
- ``ledgerEffectiveTime`` (optional)
- ``transactionId`` (optional)

Projection
==========

The ``Projection`` keeps track of the projection process and decides which events will be projected from the ``BatchSource``.

A Projection:

- has a `ProjectionId` that must uniquely identify the projection process.
- has an ``Offset`` which is used as a starting point to read from the ledger.
- has a ``ProjectionFilter``. The ``BatchSource`` uses this filter to select events from the ledger. (If you are familiar with the gRPC service, the ``ProjectionFilter`` translates to a ``TransactionFilter``)
- specifies an SQL table to project to with a ``ProjectionTable``.
- optionally has a ``Predicate`` to filter events that were read from the ledger.
- optionally has an end ``Offset``, if set the projection ends when a transaction for the ``Offset`` has been read from the ledger.
- is stored in the ``projection`` SQL table.

A newly created projection by default has no offset, which means a projection starts from the beginning of the ledger.
A projection updates when it successfully commits transactions into the SQL database according to transactions that were committed on the ledger.
A projection resumes from its stored offset automatically, if it can be found by its `ProjectionId`.

The code below shows an example of how to create a `Projection`:

.. code-block:: java

    var projectionTable = new ProjectionTable("ious");
    var eventsProjection =
      Projection.<Event>create(
        new ProjectionId("iou-projection-for-party"),
        ProjectionFilter.parties(Set.of(partyId))
      );

The ``eventsProjection`` ``Projection`` selects ``Event``\s that occurred visible to the party ``partyId`` to the ``ious`` SQL table.

The Project function
====================

The `Project<E,A>` function projects an event `Envelope<E>` into a `List<A>`.
For the ``project`` methods on ``JdbcProjector``, `A` is a ``JdbcAction``.

The code below shows an example of a ``Project`` function that handles `CreatedEvents` and `ArchivedEvents`.

.. code-block:: java

    Project<Event, JdbcAction> f =
      envelope -> {
        var event = envelope.getEvent();
        if (event instanceof CreatedEvent) {
          Iou.Contract iou = Iou.Contract.fromCreatedEvent((CreatedEvent) event);
          var action =
            ExecuteUpdate.create(
              "insert into "
              + projectionTable.getName()
              + "(contract_id, event_id, amount, currency) "
              + "values (?, ?, ?, ?)"
            )
            .bind(1, event.getContractId(), Bind.String())
            .bind(2, event.getEventId(), Bind.String())
            .bind(3, iou.data.amount, Bind.BigDecimal())
            .bind(4, iou.data.currency, Bind.String());
          return List.of(action);
        } else {
          var action =
            ExecuteUpdate.create(
              "delete from " +
              projectionTable.getName() +
              " where contract_id = ?"
            )
            .bind(1, event.getContractId(), Bind.String());
          return List.of(action);
        }
      };

The ``Project`` function `f` creates an insert action for every ``CreatedEvent`` and a delete action for every ``ArchivedEvent``.
The ``JdbcAction``\s are further explained in the next section.

The JdbcAction
--------------

A database action captures a SQL statement that is executed by a ``Projector``.
The ``JdbcAction`` is an interface with one method, shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: java

    public int execute(java.sql.Connection con);

All actions extend ``JdbcAction``. ``execute`` should return the number of rows affected by the action.
The ``ExecuteUpdate`` action creates an insert, delete, or update statement.
The example below shows how an insert statement can be created, and how arguments can be bound to the statement:

.. code-block:: java

    ExecuteUpdate.create(
        "insert into "
        + projectionTable.getName()
        + "(contract_id, event_id, amount, currency) "
        + "values (?, ?, ?, ?)")
        .bind(1, event.getContractId(), Bind.String())
        .bind(2, event.getEventId(), Bind.String())
        .bind(3, iou.data.amount, Bind.BigDecimal())
        .bind(4, iou.data.currency, Bind.String());

It is also possible to use named parameters, which is shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: java

    ExecuteUpdate.create(
        "insert into "
        + projectionTable.getName()
        + "(contract_id, event_id, amount, currency) "
        + "values (:cid, :eid, :amount, :currency)")
        .bind("cid", event.getContractId(), Bind.String())
        .bind("eid", event.getEventId(), Bind.String())
        .bind("amount", iou.data.amount, Bind.BigDecimal())
        .bind("currency", iou.data.currency, Bind.String());

Projecting rows in batches
--------------------------

The `ExecuteUpdate` action internally creates a new ``java.sql.PreparedStatement`` when it is executed.
Use `UpdateMany` if you want to reuse the ``java.sql.PreparedStatement`` and add statements in batches, which can make a considerable difference to performance.
The example below shows how you can use ``projectRows`` to project using ``UpdateMany``.
In this case we are using a code generated ``Iou.Contract`` class to function as a `Row`, which we use to bind to a SQL statement
which is executed in batches.

.. code-block:: java

    var projectionTable = new ProjectionTable("ious");
    var contracts = Projection.<Iou.Contract>create(
      new ProjectionId("iou-contracts-for-party"),
      ProjectionFilter.parties(Set.of(partyId)),
      projectionTable
    );
    var batchSource = BatchSource.create(grpcClientSettings,
        e -> {
          return Iou.Contract.fromCreatedEvent(e);
        });
    Project<Iou.Contract, Iou.Contract> mkRow =
        envelope -> {
          return List.of(envelope.getEvent());
        };
    Binder<Iou.Contract> binder = Sql.<Iou.Contract>binder(
        "insert into "
        + projectionTable.getName()
        + "(contract_id, event_id, amount, currency) "
        + "values (:contract_id, :event_id, :amount, :currency)")
        .bind("contract_id", iou -> iou.id.contractId, Bind.String())
        .bind("event_id", iou -> null, Bind.String())
        .bind("amount", iou -> iou.data.amount, Bind.BigDecimal())
        .bind("currency", iou -> iou.data.currency, Bind.String());
    BatchRows<Iou.Contract, JdbcAction> batchRows =
        UpdateMany.create(binder);
    var control =
        projector.projectRows(
            batchSource,
            contracts,
            batchRows,
            mkRow
        );

The ``Project`` function just returns the ``Iou.Contract`` since we can use this directly for our insert statement.
Next we use a ``Binder`` to bind the ``Iou.Contract`` to the insert statement.
The ``UpdateMany.create`` creates a ``BatchRow``\s function that transforms a ``List`` of rows, in this case ``Iou.Contract``\s, into a single ``JdbcAction``.
``projectRows`` starts the projection process, converting created ``Iou.Contract``\s into rows in the ``ious`` table.

Configuration
*************

The Custom Views library uses the `Lightbend config library <https://github.com/lightbend/config>`_ for configuration.
The library is packaged with a ``reference.conf`` file which specifies default settings. The next sections describe the default confguration settings.
You can override the configuration by using an ``application.conf`` file, see `using the Lightbend config library <https://github.com/lightbend/config#using-the-library>`_ for more details.

Database migration with Flyway
==============================

`Flyway <https://flywaydb.org/documentation/>`_ is used for database migration. Resources to create and migrate the database objects
that the library needs internally are provided, for instance for the `projection` table that is used to persist `Projection`\s.

The internal SQL scripts are provided in the jar at `/db/migration/projection`.

The `reference.conf` file configures this by default, shown below:

.. code-block:: none

    projection {
      # The name of the projection table which keeps track of all projections by projection-id
      projection-table-name = "projection"
      # database migration configuration
      flyway {
        # location of flyway migration schemas for internal bookkeeping (the projection-table).
        internal-locations = ["db/migration/projection"]
        # Override locations to provide your own flyway scripts.
        locations = []
        # If set to true, database migration is executed automatically.
        migrate-on-start = true
      }
    }

The `projection` table is created automatically when a projection process is started with the ``project``, ``projectRows``, or ``projectEvents`` method on ``Projector``.
Provide additional flyway locations with the `projection.flyway.locations` configuration parameter and bundle your own resources as explained
`in the Flyway documentation <https://flywaydb.org/documentation/concepts/migrations#discovery>`_. This makes it possible to create and migrate
database tables and other database objects required for your projections automatically when a projection is (re-)started.

If you do not want to use Flyway database migration, set `projection.flyway.migrate-on-start` to false. In that case you have to create the `projection` table yourself as well.

Batcher configuration
=====================

A ``Batch`` consists of 1 to many events, and optionally contains a marker that indicates that a transaction has been committed on the ledger.

Both the ``batch-size`` and the ``batch-interval`` are configured in the reference.conf:

.. code-block:: none

    projection {
      batch-size = 10000
      batch-interval = 1 second
    }

Dispatcher configuration for blocking operation
===============================================

A default dedicated dispatcher for blocking operations (e.g. db operation) is configured in reference.conf:

.. code-block:: none

    projection {
      blocking-io-dispatcher {
        type = Dispatcher
        executor = "thread-pool-executor"
        thread-pool-executor {
          fixed-pool-size = 16
        }
        throughput = 1
      }
    }

Ledger API Authorization
========================

The client must provide an access token when authorization is required by the Ledger.
For details of ledger authorization, please refer to `Ledger Authorization documentation <https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/authorization.html>`_.

Provide access token to custom-view library
-------------------------------------------

Applications can provide an access token when setting up the client. The example below shows how to set `LedgerCallCredentials` on the `GrpcClientSettings`.

.. code-block:: java

    var grpcClientSettings = GrpcClientSettings
      .connectToServiceAt("localhost", 6865, system)
      .withCallCredentials(new LedgerCallCredentials(accessToken));
    var source = BatchSource.events(grpcClientSettings);
    var control = projector.project(source, events, f);

Provide a newly retrieved access token when the existing one has expired
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an access token is expired, an application can retrieve a new access token with the stored refresh token.
For details on the refresh token, please refer to `Ledger auth-middleware documentation <https://docs.daml.com/tools/auth-middleware/index.html#refresh-access-token>`_.
With the new access token, an application can cancel the running projection and re-create a new one using the new token.

.. code-block:: java

    control.cancel().thenApply(done -> {
      var sourceWithNewToken = BatchSource.events(
        grpcClientSettings.withCallCredentials(new LedgerCallCredentials(newAccessToken))
      );
      return projector.project(sourceWithNewToken, events, f);
    });
