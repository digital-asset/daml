Tutorial
########

This tutorial guides you through a series of steps to write a simple application.

The purpose is to learn the basics of how to use the Node.js bindings.

The task is to build an application able to send and receive "ping" messages.

The focus is not on the complexity of the model, but rather on how to use the bindings to interact with the ledger.

Create the project
******************

Start from the skeleton available `here <https://github.com/digital-asset/ex-tutorial-nodejs>`_.

To set it up, clone the repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/digital-asset/ex-tutorial-nodejs.git
    cd ex-tutorial-nodejs

The skeleton includes ``daml/PingPong.daml``, which is the source for a DAML module with two templates: ``Ping`` and ``Pong``. The app uses these.

Run the sandbox
***************

Use the sandbox to run and test your application.

Now that you created the project and you're in its directory, start the sandbox by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    da sandbox

Starting the sandbox automatically compiles ``PingPong.daml`` and loads it.

Run the skeleton app
********************

You are now set to write your own application. The template includes a skeleton app that connects to a running ledger and quits.

1. Install the dependencies for your package (including the bindings):

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install

2. Start the application:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start

3. Verify the output is correct

.. code-block:: bash

    hello from <LEDGER_ID>

Understand the skeleton
***********************

The code for the script you just ran is ``index.js``.

Let's go through the skeleton part by part to understand what's going on:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const da = require('@da/daml-ledger').data;

    const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');

The first line loads the bindings and allows you to refer to them through the ``da`` object.

The second one introduces a dependency that is going to be later used to generate unique identifiers; no need to worry about it now.

.. code-block:: javascript

    let [, , host, port] = process.argv;

    host = host || 'localhost';
    port = port || 6865;

These lines read the command-line arguments and provide some sensible defaults.

Now to the juicy part:

.. code-block:: javascript

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;
        console.log('hello from', client.ledgerId);
    });

Here the application connects to the ledger with the ``DamlLedgerClient.connect`` method.

It accepts two arguments: 

- an object with the connection options
- a callback to be invoked when the connection either fails or succeeds

The connection options require you to pass the ``host`` and ``port`` of the ledger instance you are connecting to.

The callback follows the common pattern in Node.js of being invoked with two arguments: the first is an error in case of failure while the latter is the response in case of success.

In this case in particular, the response in case of success is a ``client`` object that can be used to communicate with the ledger.

The skeleton application just prints the greeting message with the ledger identifier and quits.

Retrieve the package identifiers
********************************

Now that the sandbox is running, the ``PingPong.daml`` file has been compiled and the module loaded onto the ledger.

In order for you to refer to the templates therein you need its package identifier.

This template includes a script that connects to a running ledger instance and downloads the package identifiers for the templates.

Run it now:

.. code-block:: javascript

    npm run fetch-template-ids

If the program ran successfully, the project root now contains the ``template-ids.json`` file.

It's time to write some code to verify that you're good to go. Open the ``index.js`` file and edit it.

First of all, right after the first ``require`` statement, add a new one to load the ``template-ids.json`` file that has just been created.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const da = require('@da/daml-ledger').data;
    const templateIds = require('./template-ids.json');

Right beneath that line, initialize two constants to hold the ``Ping`` and ``Pong`` template identifiers:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const PING = templateIds['PingPong.Ping'];
    const PONG = templateIds['PingPong.Pong'];

Finally print the template identifiers:

.. code-block:: bash

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;
        console.log('hello from', client.ledgerId);
        console.log('Ping', PING);
        console.log('Pong', PONG);
    });

Run the application again (``npm start``) to see an output like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    hello from sandbox-3957952d-f475-4d2f-be89-245a0799d2c0
    Ping { packageId:
    '5976641aeea761fa8946ea004b318a74d869ee305fafcdc6bf98d31fa354304d',
    name: 'PingPong.Ping' }
    Pong { packageId:
    '5976641aeea761fa8946ea004b318a74d869ee305fafcdc6bf98d31fa354304d',
    name: 'PingPong.Pong' }

The ``PingPong`` module
***********************

Before moving on to the implementation of the application, have a look at ``daml/PingPong.daml`` to understand the module the app uses.

``Ping`` and ``Pong`` are almost identical. Looking at them in detail:

- both have a ``sender`` signatory and a ``receiver`` observer
- the receiver of a ``Ping`` can exercise the ``ReplyPong`` choice, creating a ``Pong`` contract with swapped ``sender`` and ``receiver``
- symmetrically, the receiver of a ``Pong`` contract can exercise the ``ReplyPing`` choice, creating a ``Ping`` contract with swapped parties

Note that the contracts carry a counter: when the counter reaches 3, no new contract is created and the exchange stops.

Pass the parties as parameters
******************************

Everything's now ready to start working. Edit the ``index.js`` file.

Each contract has a sender and a receiver, so your application needs to establish it.

Read those from the command line by editing the part where the arguments are read as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    let [, , sender, receiver, host, port] = process.argv;
    host = host || 'localhost';
    port = port || 6865;
    if (!sender || !receiver) {
        console.log('Missing sender and/or receiver arguments, exiting.');
        process.exit(-1);
    }

Try to run it without arguments (or with just one) to see the error popping up.

Try to run it with both arguments to see the application working just as it did before.

Create a contract
*****************

To kickstart the exchange between two parties you have to first make one party *"send"* the initial ping to the other.

To do this you need to create a ``Ping`` contract.

This requires you to submit a command to the ledger. For this, use the ``CommandService``.

The ``client`` object returned by the ``DamlLedgerClient.connect`` method contains a reference to all services exposed by the ledger, including the ``CommandService``.

First of all, the following is the ``request`` for the ``CommandService``. Have a look at it:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const request = {
        commands: {
            applicationId: 'PingPongApp',
            workflowId: `Ping-${sender}`,
            commandId: uuidv4(),
            ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
            maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
            party: sender,
            list: [
                {
                    create: {
                        templateId: PING,
                        arguments: {
                            fields: {
                                sender: { party: sender },
                                receiver: { party: receiver },
                                count: { int64: 0 }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    };

This object represents the submission of a set of commands to be applied atomically. Let's see what each bit of it means:

- ``applicationId``
    the name of your application
- ``commandId``
    a unique identifier for the set of submitted commands
- ``workflowId``
    an (optional) identifier you can use to group together commands pertaining to one of your workflows
- ``ledgerEffectiveTime``
    the time at which the set of submitted commands are applied; normally the client's current epoch time, but, since the sandbox (by default) runs with a static time fixed at epoch 0, use this value
- ``maximumRecordTime``
    the time at which the command is considered expired if it's not been applied yet; the difference with the ``maximumRecordTime`` is the time-to-live (TTL) of the command
- ``party``
    who's submitting the command

Finally, ``list`` contains all the commands to be applied. In this case, it submits a ``create`` command.

Have a look at the only command:

- ``templateId``
    the identifier of the template of the contract you wish to create (``Ping``)
- ``arguments``
    an object containing the ``fields`` necessary to create the contract

The keys of the ``fields`` object are the template parameter names as they appear on ``daml/PingPong.daml``, while the values are a pair with the type and the value being passed (in this case two parties).

The request can now be passed to the ``CommandService`` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    client.commandClient.submitAndWait(request, (error, _) => {
        if (error) throw error;
        console.log(`Created Ping contract from ${sender} to ${receiver}.`);
    });

This is already a sizeable chunk of code that performs a clearly defined task. Within the body of the ``connect`` callback, wrap the code from this section in a function called ``createFirstPing`` and call it.

The code should now look like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;

        createFirstPing();

        function createFirstPing() {
            const request = {
                commands: {
                    applicationId: 'PingPongApp',
                    workflowId: `Ping-${sender}`,
                    commandId: uuidv4(),
                    ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    party: sender,
                    list: [
                        {
                            create: {
                                templateId: PING,
                                arguments: {
                                    fields: {
                                        sender: { party: sender },
                                        receiver: { party: receiver },
                                        count: { int64: 0 }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            };
            client.commandClient.submitAndWait(request, (error, _) => {
                if (error) throw error;
                console.log(`Created Ping contract from ${sender} to ${receiver}.`);
            });
        }

    });

Time to test your application. Run it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Alice Bob

You should see the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Created Ping contract from Alice to Bob.

Your application now successfully creates a ``Ping`` contract on the ledger, congratulations!

Read the transactions
*********************

Now that the application can create a contract to send a *ping*, it must also be able to listen to *pongs* on the ledger so that it can react to those.

The ``TransactionService`` exposes the functionality to read transactions from the ledger via the ``getTransactions`` method.

This method takes the following request:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const filtersByParty = {};
    filtersByParty[sender] = { inclusive: { templateIds: [PING, PONG] } };
    const request = {
        begin: { boundary: da.LedgerOffset.Boundary.END },
        filter: { filtersByParty: filtersByParty }
    };

Have a look at the request:

- ``begin``
    the offset at which you'll start reading transactions from the ledger. In this case you want to listen starting from the latest one (represented by the constant ``da.LedgerOffset.Boundary.END``)
- ``end``
    the optional offset at which you want the reads to end -- if absent (as in this case) the application keeps listening to incoming transactions
- ``filter``
    represents which contracts you want the ledger to show you: in this case you are asking for the transactions visible to ``sender`` containing contracts whose ``templateId`` matches either ``PING`` or ``PONG``.

When the ``getTransactions`` method is invoked with this request the application listens to the latest transactions coming to the ledger.

The output of this method is a Node.js stream. As such, you can register callbacks on the ``'data'`` and ``'error'`` events.

The following code prints the incoming transaction and quits in case of ``'error'``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const transactions = client.transactionClient.getTransactions(request);
    console.log(`${sender} starts reading transactions.`);
    transactions.on('data', response => {
        for (const transaction of response.transactions) {
            console.log('Transaction read:', transaction.transactionId);
        }
    });
    transactions.on('error', error => {
        console.error(`${sender} encountered an error while processing transactions!`);
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(-1);
    });

.. note::

    If your request specified an ``end``, it would most probably make sense to register an ``'end'`` event callback on the stream as well.

Again, this code represents a sizeable chunk of code with a clearly defined purpose.

Wrap this code in a new function called ``listenForTransactions``, place it within the ``connect`` callback and call ``listenForTransactions`` right before you call ``createFirstPing``.

When you are done, your code should look like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;

        listenForTransactions();
        createFirstPing();

        function createFirstPing() {
            const request = {
                commands: {
                    applicationId: 'PingPongApp',
                    workflowId: `Ping-${sender}`,
                    commandId: uuidv4(),
                    ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    party: sender,
                    list: [
                        {
                            create: {
                                templateId: PING,
                                arguments: {
                                    fields: {
                                        sender: { party: sender },
                                        receiver: { party: receiver },
                                        count: { int64: 0 }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            };
            client.commandClient.submitAndWait(request, error => {
                if (error) throw error;
                console.log(`Created Ping contract from ${sender} to ${receiver}.`);
            });
        }

        function listenForTransactions() {
            console.log(`${sender} starts reading transactions.`);
            const filtersByParty = {};
            filtersByParty[sender] = { inclusive: { templateIds: [PING, PONG] } };
            const request = {
                begin: { boundary: da.LedgerOffset.Boundary.END },
                filter: { filtersByParty: filtersByParty }
            };
            const transactions = client.transactionClient.getTransactions(request);
            transactions.on('data', response => {
                for (const transaction of response.transactions) {
                    console.log('Transaction read:', transaction.transactionId);
                }
            });
            transactions.on('error', error => {
                console.error(`${sender} encountered an error while processing transactions!`);
                console.error(error);
                process.exit(-1);
            });
        }

    });

Your application now should:

- start listening to pings and pongs visible to the sender
- create the first ping
- receive the ping it created and print its transaction identifer

If you now run

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Alice Bob

You should see an output like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    Alice starts reading transactions.
    Created Ping contract from Alice to Bob.
    Transaction read: 1

Your application is now able to create contracts and listen to transactions on the ledger. Very good!
You can now hit CTRL-C to quit the application.

Exercise a choice
*****************

The last piece of functionality you need consists of reacting to pings and pongs that you read from the ledger, represented by the creation of contracts.

For this, use again the ``submitAndWait`` method.

In particular, make your program exercise a choice: ``ReplyPing`` when you receive a ``Pong`` and vice versa.

You need to react to events in transactions as they are received in the ``listenForTransactions`` function.

The ``transaction`` object whose ``transactionId`` you printed so far contains an array of ``event`` objects, each representing an ``archived`` or ``created`` event on a contract.

What you want to do is loop through the events in the transaction and extract the ``receiver`` and ``count`` fields from ``created`` events.

You then want to decide which reply to give (either ``ReplyPing`` or ``ReplyPong``) based on the contract that has been read.

For each created event, you want to send a command that reacts to it, specifying that you want to either exercise the ``ReplyPing`` choice of a ``Pong`` contract or vice versa.

The following snippet of code does precisely this.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const reactions = [];
    for (const event of events) {
        const { receiver: { party: receiver }, count: { int64: count } } = event.arguments.fields;
        if (receiver === sender) {
            const templateId = event.templateId;
            const contractId = event.contractId;
            const reaction = templateId.name == PING.name ? 'ReplyPong' : 'ReplyPing';
            console.log(`${sender} (workflow ${workflowId}): ${reaction} at count ${count}`);
            reactions.push({
                exercise: {
                    templateId: templateId,
                    contractId: contractId,
                    choice: reaction,
                    argument: { record: { fields: {} } }
                }
            });
        }
    }

You can now use the ``submitAndWait`` command to send the ``reactions`` to the ledger.

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (reactions.length > 0) {
        const request = {
            commands: {
                applicationId: 'PingPongApp',
                workflowId: workflowId,
                commandId: uuidv4(),
                ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
                maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
                party: sender,
                list: reactions
            }
        }
        client.commandClient.submitAndWait(request, error => {
            if (error) throw error;
        });
    }

Wrap this code into a new function ``react`` that takes a ``workflowId`` and an ``events`` array with the ``created`` events. Then edit the ``listenForTransactions`` function to:

- accept one parameter called ``callback``
- instead of printing the transaction identifier, for each transaction

    * push the ``created`` events to an array
    * pass that array to the ``callback`` (along with the workflow identifier)

Finally, pass the ``react`` function as a parameter to the only call of ``listenForTransactions``.

Your code should now look like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;

        listenForTransactions(react);
        createFirstPing();

        function createFirstPing() {
            const request = {
                commands: {
                    applicationId: 'PingPongApp',
                    workflowId: `Ping-${sender}`,
                    commandId: uuidv4(),
                    ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    party: sender,
                    list: [
                        {
                            create: {
                                templateId: PING,
                                arguments: {

            }
        }
    });

To test your code you need to run two different commands in two different terminals.

First, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Alice Bob

After starting this, the application creates a ping contract on the ledger and waits for replies.

.. code-block:: bash

    Alice starts reading transactions.
    Created Ping contract from Alice to Bob.

Keep this command running, open a new shell and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Bob Alice

You should now see the exchange happening on both terminals.

``npm start Alice Bob``

.. code-block:: bash

    Alice starts reading transactions.
    Created Ping contract from Alice to Bob.
    Alice (workflow Ping-Bob): Pong at count 0
    Alice (workflow Ping-Bob): Pong at count 2

``npm start Bob Alice``

.. code-block:: bash

    Bob starts reading transactions.
    Created Ping contract from Bob to Alice.
    Bob (workflow Ping-Bob): Ping at count 1
    Bob (workflow Ping-Bob): Ping at count 3

You can now close both applications.

Your application is now able to complete the full exchange. Very well done!


The Active Contracts Service
****************************

So far so good, but there is a flaw. You might have noticed that the application is subscribing for transactions using ``boundary: da.LedgerOffset.Boundary.END``. This means that wherever the ledger is at that time, the application is going to see transactions only after that, missing contracts created earlier. This problem could be addressed by subscribing for transactions from ``boundary: da.LedgerOffset.Boundary.BEGIN``, but then in case of a downtime your application would need to be prepared to handle contracts it has already processed before. To make this recovery easier the API offers a service which returns the set of active contracts on the ledger and an offset with which one can subscribe for transactions. This facilitates ramping up new applications and you can be sure to see contracts only once.

In this new example the application first processes the current active contracts. Since that process is asynchronous the rest of the program should be passed in as a callback. 

.. code-block:: javascript

    function processActiveContracts(transactionFilter, callback, onComplete) {
            const request = { filter: transactionFilter };
            const activeContracts = client.activeContractsClient.getActiveContracts(request);
            let offset = undefined;
            activeContracts.on('data', response => {
                if (response.activeContracts) {
                    const events = [];
                    for (const activeContract of response.activeContracts) {
                        events.push(activeContract);
                    }

                    if (events.length > 0) {
                        callback(response.workflowId, events);
                    }
                }          
               
                if (response.offset) {
                    offset = response.offset;
                }
            });    

            activeContracts.on('error', error => {
                console.error(`${sender} encountered an error while processing active contracts!`);
                console.error(error);
                process.exit(-1);
            });    

            activeContracts.on('end', () => onComplete(offset));
        }


Note that the transaction filter was factored out as it can be shared. The final code would look like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const da = require('@da/daml-ledger').data;
    const templateIds = require('./template-ids.json');    

    const PING = templateIds['PingPong.Ping'];
    const PONG = templateIds['PingPong.Pong'];    

    const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');    

    let [, , sender, receiver, host, port] = process.argv;
    host = host || 'localhost';
    port = port || 6865;
    if (!sender || !receiver) {
        console.log('Missing sender and/or receiver arguments, exiting.');
        process.exit(-1);
    }    

    da.DamlLedgerClient.connect({ host: host, port: port }, (error, client) => {
        if (error) throw error;    

        const filtersByParty = {};
        filtersByParty[sender] = { inclusive: { templateIds: [PING, PONG] } };
        const transactionFilter = { filtersByParty: filtersByParty };            

        processActiveContracts(transactionFilter, react, offset => {
            listenForTransactions(offset, transactionFilter, react);
            createFirstPing();
        });        

        function createFirstPing() {
            const request = {

                    ledgerEffectiveTime: { seconds: 0, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    maximumRecordTime: { seconds: 5, nanoseconds: 0 },
                    party: sender,

                                        count: { int64: 0 }

        }

            const request = {

    });

Before running this you should start with a clean ledger to avoid being confused by the unprocessed contracts from previous examples.

.. code-block:: bash

    da stop
    da sandbox

Then run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Alice Bob

in another shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start Bob Alice

You should see the following outputs respectively:

.. code-block:: bash

    processing active contracts for Alice
    Alice starts reading transactions from offset: 0.
    Created Ping contract from Alice to Bob.
    Alice (workflow Ping-Bob): Pong at count 0
    Alice (workflow Ping-Alice): Ping at count 1
    Alice (workflow Ping-Bob): Pong at count 2
    Alice (workflow Ping-Alice): Ping at count 3

.. code-block:: bash

    processing active contracts for Bob
    Bob (workflow Ping-Alice): Pong at count 0
    Bob starts reading transactions from offset: 1.
    Created Ping contract from Bob to Alice.
    Bob (workflow Ping-Bob): Ping at count 1
    Bob (workflow Ping-Alice): Pong at count 2
    Bob (workflow Ping-Bob): Ping at count 3

Alice joining an empty ledger has no active contracts to process. Bob however, who joins later, will see Alice's ``Ping`` contract and process it. Afterwards he will continue listening to transactions from offset 1.
