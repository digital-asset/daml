New Quickstart guide
####################

The goal of this tutorial is to get you up and running with full-stack, DAML-driven app development. We will provide you with the template for a miniature social networking app, get you writing your first end-to-end feature and finally deploy your new app to a persistent ledger.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have an idea of what DAML contracts and ledgers are, how the UI interacts with them, and how you might solve a potential use case with a DAML-driven solution. We do not aim to give a comprehensive guide to all DAML concepts and tools; for that, see the later sections of the documentation. With that, let's get started!

.. TODO: reference specific sections of docs instead of saying "later sections".

Prerequisites
*************

If you haven't already, see :doc:`installation` for the DAML SDK and VSCode development environment.

You will also need some common software tools to build and interact with the template project.

- `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system
- `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/>`_ package manager for Javascript
- A terminal application for command line interaction


Setting up
**********

First off, open a terminal and clone the template project using
``git clone https://github.com/digital-asset/create-daml-app.git``
