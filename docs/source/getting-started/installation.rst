Installing the SDK
##################

1. Install the dependencies
***************************

The DAML Connect SDK currently runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.

You need to install:

1. `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_.
2. JDK 8 or greater. If you don't already have a JDK installed, try `AdoptOpenJDK <https://adoptopenjdk.net>`_.

   As part of the installation process you might need to set up the ``JAVA_HOME`` variable. You can find here the instructions on how to do it on :doc:`Windows,macOS, and Linux <path-variables>`.

2. Install the SDK
*******************

Windows 10
==========

Download and run the installer_, which will install DAML and set up your PATH.

.. _mac-linux-sdk:

Mac and Linux
=============

To install the SDK on Mac or Linux open a terminal and run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      curl -sSL https://get.daml.com/ | sh

The installer will setup the ``PATH`` variable for you. In order for it to take effect, you will have to
log out and log in again.


Next steps
**********

- Follow the :doc:`getting started guide </getting-started/index>`.
- Use ``daml --help`` to see all the commands that the DAML assistant (``daml``) provides.
- If the ``daml`` command is not available in your terminal after logging out and logging in again, you need to set the ``PATH`` environment variable
  manually. You can find instructions on how to do this :doc:`here <path-variables>`.
- If you run into any other problems, you can use the :doc:`support page </support/support>` to get in touch with us.
