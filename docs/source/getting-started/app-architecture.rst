App Architecture
****************

In this section we'll look at the different components of the social network app we created in  `Building Your App <https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/index.html>`_. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the basics of Daml architecture enough to feel comfortable extending the code with a new feature in the next section. There are two main components:

  * the Daml model
  * the React/TypeScript frontend

We generate TypeScript code to bridge the two.

Overall, the social networking app is following the :ref:`recommended architecture of a fullstack Daml application <recommended-architecture>`. Below you can see a simplified version of the architecture represented in the app.

.. image:: ./images/gsg_architecture.svg
   :alt: An architectural diagram of the app from this guide. A full text explanation is found in the paragraph immediately below. 

There are three types of building blocks that go into our application: user code, Daml components, and generated code from Daml. The Daml model determines the DAR files that underpin both the front end and back end. The front-end includes React application code, Daml react libraries, and Typescript generated code, while the back-end consists of a JSON API server and a participant node.

Let's start by looking at the Daml model, which defines the core logic of the application. Have `the Daml cheat-sheet <https://docs.daml.com/cheat-sheet/>`_ open in a separate tab for a quick overview of the most common Daml concepts.

The Daml Model
==============

In your terminal, navigate to the root ``create-daml-app`` directory and run::

  daml studio

This should open the Visual Studio Code editor at the root of the project.
(You may get a new tab pop up with release notes for the latest version of Daml - close this.)
Using the file *Explorer* on the left sidebar, navigate to the ``daml`` folder and double-click on the ``User.daml`` file.

The Daml code defines the *data* and *workflow* of the application.
Both are described in the ``User`` contract *template*.
Let's look at the data portion first:

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/daml/User.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- MAIN_TEMPLATE_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- MAIN_TEMPLATE_END

There are two important aspects here:

1. The data definition (a *schema* in database terms), describing the data stored with each user contract.
In this case it is an identifier for the user and the list of users they are following.
Both fields use the built-in ``Party`` type which lets us use them in the following clauses.

2. The signatories and observers of the contract.
The signatories are the parties whose authorization is required to create or archive contracts, in this case the user herself.
The observers are the parties who are able to view the contract on the ledger.
In this case all users that a particular user is following are able to see the user contract.

It's also important to distinguish between parties, users, and aliases in terms of naming:
 - Parties are unique across the entire Daml network. These must be allocated before you can use them to log in, and allocation results in a random-looking (but not actually random) string that identifies the party and is used in your Daml code. Parties are a builtin concept.
 - On each participant node you can create users with human-readable user ids. Each user can be associated with one or more parties allocated on that participant node, and refers to that party only on that node. Users are a purely local concept, meaning you can never address a user on another node by user id, and you never work with users in your Daml code; party ids are always used for these purposes. Users are also a builtin concept.
 - Lastly we have user aliases. These are not a builtin concept, they are defined by an *Alias template* (discussed below) within the specific model used in this guide. Aliases serve as a way to address parties on all nodes via a human readable name.

The social network users discussed in this guide are really a combination of all three of these concepts. Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all aliases that correspond to a single test user and a single party id each. As part of running `daml start`, the `init-script` specified in `daml.yaml` is executed. This points at the `Setup:setup` function which defines a :doc:`Daml Script </daml-script/index>` which creates 3 users `alice`, `bob` and `charlie` as well as a corresponding party for each they can act as. In addition to that, we also create a separate public party and allow the three users to read contracts for that party. This allows us to share the alias contracts with that public party and have them be visible to all 3 users.

Now let's see what the ``signatory`` and ``observer`` clauses mean in our app in more concrete terms.
The user with the alias Alice can see another user, alias Bob, in the network only when Bob is following Alice (only if Alice is in the ``following`` list in his user contract). For this to be true, Bob must have previously started to follow Alice, as he is the sole signatory on his user contract.
If not, Bob will be invisible to Alice.

This illustrates two concepts that are central to Daml: *authorization* and *privacy*.
Authorization is about who can *do* what, and privacy is about who can *see* what.
In Daml you must answer these questions upfront, as they are fundamental to the design of the application.

The next part of the Daml model is the operation to follow users, called a *choice* in Daml:

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/daml/User.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- FOLLOW_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- FOLLOW_END

Daml contracts are *immutable* (can not be changed in place), so the only way to update one is to archive it and create a new instance.
That is what the ``Follow`` choice does: after checking some preconditions, it archives the current user contract and creates a new one with the new user to follow added to the list. Here is a quick explanation of the code:

    - The choice starts with the ``nonconsuming choice`` keyword followed by the choice name ``Follow``.
    - The return type of a choice is defined next. In this case it is ``ContractId User``.
    - After that we declare choice parameters with the ``with`` keyword. Here this is the user we want to start following.
    - The keyword ``controller`` defines the ``Party`` that is allowed to execute the choice. In this case, it is the ``username`` party associated with the ``User`` contract.
    - The ``do`` keyword marks the start of the choice body where its functionality will be written.
    - After passing some checks, the current contract is archived with ``archive self``.
    - A new ``User`` contract with the new user we have started following is created (the new user is added to the ``following`` list).

More detailed information on choices can be found in :doc:`our docs </daml/reference/choices>`.

Finally, the ``User.daml`` file contains the Alias template that manages the link between user ids and their aliases. The alias template sets the public party we created in the setup script as the observer of the contract. Because we allow all users to read contracts visible to the public party, this allows e.g., Alice to see Bobâ€™s `Alias` contract.

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/daml/User.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- ALIAS_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- ALIAS_END

Let's move on to how our Daml model is reflected and used on the UI side.

TypeScript Code Generation
==========================

The user interface for our app is written in `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`_.
TypeScript is a variant of JavaScript that provides more support during development through its type system.

To build an application on top of Daml, we need a way to refer to our Daml templates and choices in TypeScript.
We do this using a Daml to TypeScript code generation tool in the SDK.

To run code generation, we first need to compile the Daml model to an archive format (a ``.dar`` file).
The ``daml codegen js`` command then takes this file as argument to produce a number of TypeScript packages in the output folder.
::

    daml build
    daml codegen js .daml/dist/create-daml-app-0.1.0.dar -o daml.js

Now we have a TypeScript interface (types and companion objects) to our Daml model, which we'll use in our UI code next.

The UI
======

On top of TypeScript, we use the UI framework `React <https://reactjs.org/>`_.
React helps us write modular UI components using a functional style - a component is rerendered whenever one of its inputs changes - with careful use of global state.

Let's see an example of a React component.
All components are in the ``ui/src/components`` folder.
You can navigate there within Visual Studio Code using the file explorer on the left sidebar.
We'll first look at ``App.tsx``, which is the entry point to our application.

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/ui/src/components/App.tsx
  :language: tsx
  :start-after: // APP_BEGIN
  :end-before: // APP_END

An important tool in the design of our components is a React feature called `Hooks <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>`_.
Hooks allow you to share and update state across components, avoiding the need to thread it through manually.
We take advantage of hooks to share ledger state across components.
Custom :doc:`Daml React hooks </app-dev/bindings-ts/daml-react>` query the ledger for contracts, create new contracts, and exercise choices. This is the library you will use most often when interacting with the ledger [#f1]_ .

The ``useState`` hook (not specific to Daml) here keeps track of the user's credentials.
If they are not set, we render the ``LoginScreen`` with a callback to ``setCredentials``.
If they are set, we render the ``MainScreen`` of the app.
This is wrapped in the ``DamlLedger`` component, a `React context <https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html>`_ with a handle to the ledger.

Let's move on to more advanced uses of our Daml React library.
The ``MainScreen`` is a simple frame around the ``MainView`` component, which houses the main functionality of our app.
It uses Daml React hooks to query and update ledger state.

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/ui/src/components/MainView.tsx
  :language: tsx
  :start-after: // USERS_BEGIN
  :end-before: // USERS_END

The ``useParty`` hook returns the current user as stored in the ``DamlLedger`` context.
A more interesting example is the ``allUsers`` line.
This uses the ``useStreamQueries`` hook to get all ``User`` contracts on the ledger.
(``User.User`` here is an object generated by ``daml codegen js`` - it stores metadata of the ``User`` template defined in ``User.daml``.)
Note however that this query preserves privacy: only users that follow the current user have their contracts revealed.
This behaviour is due to the observers on the ``User`` contract being exactly in the list of users that the current user is following.

A final point on this is the *streaming* aspect of the query.
Results are updated as they come in - there is no need for periodic or manual reloading to see updates.

Another example, showing how to *update* ledger state, is how we exercise the ``Follow`` choice of the ``User`` template.

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/ui/src/components/MainView.tsx
  :language: tsx
  :force:
  :start-after: // FOLLOW_BEGIN
  :end-before: // FOLLOW_END

The ``useLedger`` hook returns an object with methods for exercising choices.
The core of the ``follow`` function here is the call to ``ledger.exerciseByKey``.
The *key* in this case is the username of the current user, used to look up the corresponding ``User`` contract.
The wrapper function ``follow`` is then passed to the subcomponents of ``MainView``.
For example, ``follow`` is passed to the ``UserList`` component as an argument (a `prop <https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html>`_ in React terms).
This is triggered when you click the icon next to a user's name in the *Network* panel.

.. literalinclude:: code/templates-tarball/create-daml-app/ui/src/components/MainView.tsx
  :language: tsx
  :start-after: {/* USERLIST_BEGIN */}
  :end-before: {/* USERLIST_END */}

This should give you a taste of how the UI works alongside a Daml ledger.
You'll see this more as you develop :doc:`your first feature <first-feature>` for our social network.

.. rubric:: Footnotes
