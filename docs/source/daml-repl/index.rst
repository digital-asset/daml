DAML REPL
###########

The DAML REPL allows you to use the :doc:`/daml-script/index` API
interactively. This is useful for debugging and for interactively
inspecting and manipulating a ledger.

Usage
=====

First create a new project based on the ``script-example``
template. Take a look at the documentation for
:doc:`/daml-script/index` for details on this template.

.. code-block:: sh

   daml new script-example --template script-example # create a project called script-example based on the template
   cd script-example # switch to the new project

Now, build the project and start :doc:`/tools/sandbox`, the in-memory
ledger included in the SDK. Note that we are starting Sandbox in
wallclock mode. Static time is not supported in ``daml repl``.

.. code-block:: sh

   daml build
   daml sandbox --wall-clock-time --port=6865 .daml/dist/script-example-0.0.1.dar

Now that the ledger has been started, you can launch the REPL in a
separate terminal using the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   daml repl --ledger-host=localhost --ledger-port=6865 .daml/dist/script-example-0.0.1.dar --import script-example

The ``--ledger-host`` and ``--ledger-port`` parameters point to the
host and port your ledger is running on. In addition to that, you also
need to pass in the name of a DAR containing the templates and other
definitions that will be accessible in the REPL. We also specify that we want
to import all modules from the ``script-example`` package. If your modules
provide colliding definitions you can also import modules individually from
within the REPL. Note that you can also specify multiple DARs and they
will all be available.

You should now see a prompt looking like

.. code-block:: none

   daml>

You can think of this prompt like a line in a ``do``-block of the
``Script`` action. Each line of input has to have one of the following
two forms:

1. An expression ``expr`` of type ``Script a`` for some type ``a``. This
   will execute the script and print the result if ``a`` is an
   instance of ``Show`` and not ``()``.

2. A pure expression ``expr`` of type ``a`` for some type ``a`` where
   ``a`` is an instance of ``Show``. This will evaluate ``expr`` and
   print the result. If you are only interest in pure expressions you
   can also use DAML REPL
   :ref:`without connecting to a ledger <repl-no-ledger>`.

3. A binding of the form ``pat <- expr`` where ``pat`` is pattern, e.g.,
   a variable name ``x`` to bind the result to
   and ``expr`` is an expression of type ``Script a``.
   This will execute the script and match the result against
   the pattern ``pat`` bindings the matches to the variables in the pattern.
   You can then use those variables on subsequent lines.

4. A ``let`` binding of the form ``let pat = y``, where ``pat`` is a pattern
   and ``y`` is a pure expression or ``let f x = y`` to define a function.
   The bound variables can be used on subsequent lines.

5. Next to DAML code the REPL also understands REPL commands which are prefixed
   by ``:``. Enter ``:help`` to see a list of supported REPL commands.

First create two parties: A party with the display name ``"Alice"``
and the party id ``"alice"`` and a party with the display name
``"Bob"`` and the party id ``"bob"``.

.. code-block:: none

   daml> alice <- allocatePartyWithHint "Alice" (PartyIdHint "alice")
   daml> bob <- allocatePartyWithHint "Bob" (PartyIdHint "bob")

Next, create a ``CoinProposal`` from ``Alice`` to ``Bob``

.. code-block:: none

   daml> submit alice (createCmd (CoinProposal (Coin alice bob)))

As Bob, you can now get the list of active ``CoinProposal`` contracts
using the ``query`` function. The ``debug : Show a => a -> Script ()``
function can be used to print values.

.. code-block:: none

   daml> proposals <- query @CoinProposal bob
   daml> debug proposals
   [Daml.Script:39]: [(<contract-id>,CoinProposal {coin = Coin {issuer = 'alice', owner = 'bob'}})]

Finally, accept all proposals using the ``forA`` function to iterate
over them.

.. code-block:: none

   daml> forA proposals $ \(contractId, _) -> submit bob (exerciseCmd contractId Accept)

Using the ``query`` function we can now verify that there is one
``Coin`` and no ``CoinProposal``:

.. code-block:: none

   daml> coins <- query @Coin bob
   daml> debug coins
   [Daml.Script:39]: [(<contract-id>,Coin {issuer = 'alice', owner = 'bob'})]
   daml> proposals <- query @CoinProposal bob
   [Daml.Script:39]: []

To exit ``daml repl`` press ``Control-D``.


What is in scope at the prompt?
===============================

In the prompt, all modules from DALFs specified in ``--import`` are
imported automatically. In addition to that, the ``DAML.Script``
module is also imported and gives you access to the DAML Script API.

You can use the commands ``:module + ModA ModB …`` to import additional modules
and ``:module - ModA ModB …`` to remove previously added imports. Modules can
also be imported using regular import declarations instead of ``module +``.
The command ``:show imports`` lists the currently active imports.

.. code-block:: none

   daml> import DA.Time
   daml> debug (days 1)

.. _repl-no-ledger:

Using DAML REPL without a Ledger
================================

If you are only interested in pure expressions, e.g., because you want
to test how some function behaves you can omit the ``--ledger-host``
and ``-ledger-port`` parameters. DAML REPL will work as usual but any
attempts to call DAML Script APIs that interact with the ledger, e.g.,
``submit`` will result in the following error:

.. code-block:: none

    daml> java.lang.RuntimeException: No default participant

Connecting via TLS
==================

You can connect to a ledger that requires TLS by passing ``--tls``.  A
custom root certificate used for validating the server certificate can
be set via ``--cacrt``. Finally, you can also enable client
authentication by passing ``--pem client.key --crt client.crt``. If
``--cacrt`` or ``--pem`` and ``--crt`` are passed TLS is automatically
enabled so ``--tls`` is redundant.

Connection to a Ledger with Authorization
=========================================

If your ledger requires an authorization token you can pass it via
``--access-token-file``.

Using DAML REPL to convert to JSON
==================================

Using the ``:json`` command you can encode serializable DAML expressions as
JSON. For example using the definitions and imports from above:

.. code-block:: none

    daml> :json days 1
    {"microseconds":86400000000}
    daml> :json map snd coins
    [{"issuer":"alice","owner":"bob"}]
