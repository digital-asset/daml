Deploying DAML
##############

Building your application and running it locally in a development sandbox is one thing but ultimately we want to run our DAML applications on real life ledgers. To that end we've built this guide to show you how to deploy `create-daml-app` to a variety of distributed ledgers. 

It's really quite easy, and once you know how to do it on one ledger you know roughly how to do it on the rest.
