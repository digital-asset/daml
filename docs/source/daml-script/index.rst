DAML scenarios provide a simple API for testing DAML models
and getting quick feedback in DAML studio. However, scenarios are run
in a special process and do not interact with an actual ledger. This
means that you cannot use scenarios to test other ledger clients,
e.g., your UI or :doc:`DAML triggers </triggers/index>`.

DAML script addresses this problem by providing you with an API with
the simplicity of DAML scenarios and all the benefits such as being
able to reuse your DAML types and logic while running against an
actual ledger. This means that you can use it to test automation
logic, your UI but also for
:ref:`ledger initialization <script-ledger-initialization>` where scenarios
cannot be used (with the exception of :doc:`/tools/sandbox`).

You can also use DAML Script interactively using :doc:`/daml-repl/index`.

Usage
=====

Our example for this tutorial consists of 2 templates.

First, we have a template called ``Coin``:

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- COIN_TEMPLATE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- COIN_TEMPLATE_END

This template represents a coin issued to ``owner`` by ``issuer``.
``Coin`` has both the ``owner`` and the ``issuer`` as signatories.

Second, we have a template called ``CoinProposal``:

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- COIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- COIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE_END

``CoinProposal`` is only signed by the ``issuer`` and it provides a
single ``Accept`` choice which, when exercised by the controller will
create the corresponding ``Coin``.

Having defined the templates, we can now move on to write DAML scripts
that operate on these templates. To get accees to the API used to implement DAML scripts, you need to add the ``daml-script``
library to the ``dependencies`` field in ``daml.yaml``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/daml.yaml.template
   :start-after: # script-dependencies-begin
   :end-before: # script-dependencies-end

We also enable the ``ApplicativeDo`` extension. We will
see below why this is useful.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- DAML_SCRIPT_HEADER_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- DAML_SCRIPT_HEADER_END

Since on an actual ledger parties cannot be arbitrary strings, we
define a record containing all the parties that we will use in our
script so that we can easily swap them out.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- LEDGER_PARTIES_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- LEDGER_PARTIES_END

Let us now write a function to initialize the ledger with 3
``CoinProposal`` contracts and accept 2 of them. This function takes the
``LedgerParties`` as an argument and return something of type ``Script
()`` which is DAML scriptâ€™s equivalent of ``Scenario ()``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- INITIALIZE_SIGNATURE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- INITIALIZE_SIGNATURE_END

First we create the proposals. To do so, we use the ``submit``
function to submit a transaction. The first argument is the party
submitting the transaction. In our case, we want all proposals to be
created by the bank so we use ``parties.bank``. The second argument
must be of type ``Commands a`` so in our case ``Commands (ContractId
CoinProposal, ContractId CoinProposal, ContractId CoinProposal)``
corresponding to the 3 proposals that we create. ``Commands`` is
similar to ``Update`` which is used in the ``submit`` function in
scenarios. However, ``Commands`` requires that the individual commands
do not depend on each other. This matches the restriction on the
Ledger API where a transaction consists of a list of commands.  Using
``ApplicativeDo`` we can still use ``do``-notation as long as we
respect this. In ``Commands`` we use ``createCmd`` instead of
``create`` and ``exerciseCmd`` instead of ``exercise``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- INITIALIZE_PROPOSAL_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- INITIALIZE_PROPOSAL_END

Now that we have created the ``CoinProposal``\ s, we want ``Alice`` and
``Bob`` to accept the proposal while the ``Bank`` will ignore the
proposal that it has created for itself. To do so we use separate
``submit`` statements for ``Alice`` and ``Bob`` and call
``exerciseCmd``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- INITIALIZE_ACCEPT_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- INITIALIZE_ACCEPT_END

Finally, we call ``pure ()`` on the last line of our script to match
the type ``Script ()``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- INITIALIZE_PURE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- INITIALIZE_PURE_END

We have now defined a way to initialize the ledger so we can write a
test that checks that the contracts that we expect exist afterwards.

First, we define the signature of our test. We will create the parties
used here in the test, so it does not take any arguments.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- TEST_SIGNATURE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- TEST_SIGNATURE_END

Now, we create the parties using the ``allocateParty`` function. This
uses the party management service to create new parties with the given
display name. Note that the display name does not identify a party
uniquely. If you call ``allocateParty`` twice with the same display
name, it will create 2 different parties. This is very convenient for
testing since a new party cannot see any old contracts on the ledger
so using new parties for each test removes the need to reset the
ledger.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- TEST_ALLOCATE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- TEST_ALLOCATE_END

We now call the ``initialize`` function that we defined before on the
parties that we have just allocated.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- TEST_INITIALIZE_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- TEST_INITIALIZE_END

To verify the contracts on the ledger, we use the ``query``
function. We pass it the type of the template and a party. It will
then give us all active contracts of the given type visible to the
party. In our example, we expect to see one active ``CoinProposal``
for ``bank`` and one ``Coin`` contract for each of ``Alice`` and
``Bob``. We get back list of ``(ContractId t, t)`` pairs from
``query``. In our tests, we do not need the contract ids, so we throw
them away using ``map snd``.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- TEST_QUERIES_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- TEST_QUERIES_END

To run our script, we first build it with ``daml build`` and then run
it by pointing to the DAR, the name of our script, the host and
port our ledger is running on and the time mode of the ledger.

``daml script --dar .daml/dist/script-example-0.0.1.dar --script-name ScriptExample:test --ledger-host localhost --ledger-port 6865``

Up to now, we have worked with parties that we have allocated in the
test. We can also pass in the path to a file containing
the input in the :doc:`/json-api/lf-value-specification`.

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/ledger-parties.json
   :language: daml

We can then initialize our ledger passing in the json file via ``--input-file``.

``daml script --dar .daml/dist/script-example-0.0.1.dar --script-name ScriptExample:initialize --ledger-host localhost --ledger-port 6865 --input-file ledger-parties.json``

If you open Navigator, you can now see the contracts that have been created.

While we will not use it here, there is also an ``--output-file``
option that you can use to write the result of a script to a file
using the DAML-LF JSON encoding. This is particularly useful if you need to consume
the result from another program.

.. _script-ledger-initialization:

Using DAML Script for Ledger Initialization
===========================================

You can use DAML script to initialize a ledger on startup. To do so,
specify an ``init-script: ScriptExample:initializeFixed`` field in
your ``daml.yaml``. This will automatically be picked up by ``daml
start`` and used to initialize sandbox. Since it is often useful to
create a party with a specific party identifier during development, you can
use the ``allocatePartyWithHint`` function which accepts not only the
display name but also a hint for the party identifier. On Sandbox, the hint
will be used directly as the party identifier of the newly allocated
party. This allows us to implement ``initializeFixed`` as a small
wrapper around the ``initialize`` function we defined above:

.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml
   :language: daml
   :start-after: -- INITIALIZE_FIXED_BEGIN
   :end-before: -- INITIALIZE_FIXED_END

Migrating from Scenarios
------------------------

Existing scenarios that you used for ledger initialization can be
translated to DAML script but there are a few things to keep in mind:

#. You need to add ``daml-script`` to the list of dependencies in your
   ``daml.yaml``.
#. You need to import the ``Daml.Script`` module.
#. Calls to ``create``, ``exercise``, ``exerciseByKey`` and
   ``createAndExercise`` need to be suffixed with ``Cmd``, e.g.,
   ``createCmd``.
#. Instead of specifying a ``scenario`` field in your ``daml.yaml``,
   you need to specify an ``init-script`` field. The initialization
   script is specified via ``Module:identifier`` for both fields.
#. DAML script only supports the commands available on the ledger API
   so you cannot call functions like ``fetch`` directly. This is
   intentional. Your initialization scripts should not be able to
   create transactions that a ledger client would not be able to
   create. If you want to call methods not exposed via the Ledger API,
   you can create a new template with a single choice
   and call that via ``createAndExercise``.
#. You need to replace calls to ``getParty x`` by
   ``allocatePartyWithHint x (PartyIdHint x)``.

Using DAML Script in Distributed Topologies
===========================================

So far, we have run DAML script against a single participant node. It
is also more possible to run it in a setting where different parties
are hosted on different participant nodes. To do so, pass the
``--participant-config participants.json`` file to ``daml script``
instead of ``--ledger-host`` and ``ledger-port``. The file should be of the format

.. literalinclude:: ./participants-example.json
   :language: json

This will define a participant called ``one``, a default participant
and it defines that the party ``alice`` is on participant
``one``. Whenever you submit something as party, we will use the
participant for that party or if none is specified
``default_participant``. If ``default_participant`` is not specified,
using a party with an unspecified participant is an error.

``allocateParty`` will also use the ``default_participant``. If you
want to allocate a party on a specific participant, you can use
``allocatePartyOn`` which accepts the participant name as an extra
argument.

.. daml-script-json-api

Running DAML Script against the HTTP JSON API
=============================================

In some cases, you only have access to the :doc:`HTTP JSON API </json-api/index>` but not to the gRPC of a ledger, e.g., on `project:DABL <https://projectdabl.com>`_. For this usecase, DAML script can be run against the JSON API. Note that if you do have access to the gRPC API, running DAML script against the JSON API does not have any advantages.

To run DAML script against the JSON API you have to pass the ``--json-api`` parameter to ``daml script``. There are a few differences and limitations compared to running DAML Script against the gRPC API:

#. When running against the JSON API, the ``--host`` argument has to
   contain an ``http://`` or ``https://`` prefix, e.g., ``daml
   script --host http://localhost --port 7575 --json-api``.
#. The JSON API only supports single-command submissions. This means
   that within a single call to ``submit`` you can only execute one
   ledger API command, e.g., one ``createCmd`` or one ``exerciseCmd``.
#. The JSON API requires an authentication token even when it is run
   against an unauthenticated ledger. The authentication token must be
   a JWT token so the ``--access-token-file`` passed to
   ``daml script`` should contain the actual JWT token.
#. The token must contain exactly one party in ``actAs`` and/or
   ``readAs``. This party will be used for ``submit`` and
   ``query``. Passing a party as the argument to ``submit`` and
   ``query`` that is different from the party in the token is an
   error.
#. Since DAML Script only accepts a single token and the party is
   inferred from the token, this means that you can only use a single
   party within a DAML script when running against the JSON API.
