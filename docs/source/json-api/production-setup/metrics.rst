Metrics
#######

Enable and Configure Reporting
******************************


To enable metrics and configure reporting, you can use the below config block in application config:

.. code-block:: none

    metrics {
      //Start a metrics reporter. Must be one of "console", "csv:///PATH", "graphite://HOST[:PORT][/METRIC_PREFIX]", or "prometheus://HOST[:PORT]".
      reporter = "console"
      //Set metric reporting interval , examples : 1s, 30s, 1m, 1h
      reporting-interval = 30s
    }

or the two following CLI options (deprecated):

- ``--metrics-reporter``: passing a legal value will enable reporting; the accepted values
  are as follows:

  - ``console``: prints captured metrics on the standard output

  - ``csv://</path/to/metrics.csv>``: saves the captured metrics in CSV format at the specified location

  - ``graphite://<server_host>[:<server_port>]``: sends captured metrics to a Graphite server. If the port
    is omitted, the default value ``2003`` will be used.

  - ``prometheus://<server_host>[:<server_port>]``: renders captured metrics
    on a http endpoint in accordance with the prometheus protocol. If the port
    is omitted, the default value ``55001`` will be used. The metrics will be
    available under the address ``http://<server_host>:<server_port>/metrics``.

- ``--metrics-reporting-interval``: allows the user to set the interval at which metrics are pre-aggregated on the *HTTP JSON API* and sent to
  the reporter. The formats accepted are based
  on the ISO 8601 duration format ``PnDTnHnMn.nS`` with days considered to be exactly 24 hours.
  The default interval is 10 seconds.

Types of Metrics
****************

This is a list of type of metrics with all data points recorded for each.
Use this as a reference when reading the list of metrics.

Counter
=======

Number of occurrences of some event.

Meter
=====

A meter tracks the number of times a given event occurred (throughput). The following data
points are kept and reported by any meter.

- ``<metric.qualified.name>.count``: number of registered data points overall
- ``<metric.qualified.name>.m1_rate``: number of registered data points per minute
- ``<metric.qualified.name>.m5_rate``: number of registered data points every 5 minutes
- ``<metric.qualified.name>.m15_rate``: number of registered data points every 15 minutes
- ``<metric.qualified.name>.mean_rate``: mean number of registered data points

Timers
======

A timer records all metrics registered by a meter and by a histogram, where
the histogram records the time necessary to execute a given operation (
in fractional milliseconds).

List of Metrics
