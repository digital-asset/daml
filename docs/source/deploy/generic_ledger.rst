Deploying to a generic Daml ledger
==================================

Daml ledgers expose a unified administration API. This means that deploying to a Daml ledger is no
different from deploying to your local sandbox.

To deploy to a Daml ledger, run the following command from within your Daml project:

.. code-block:: none

   $ daml deploy --host=<HOST> --port=<PORT> --access-token-file=<TOKEN-FILE>

where ``<HOST>`` and ``<PORT>`` is the hostname and port your ledger is listening on, which defaults
to port ``6564``. The ``<TOKEN-FILE>`` is needed if your sandbox runs with
:ref:`authorization <authorization>` and needs to contain a JWT token with an ``admin`` claim.
If your sandbox is not setup to use any authentication it can be omitted.

Instead of passing ``--host``, ``--port`` and ``--access-token-file`` flags to the command above,
you can add the following section to the project's ``daml.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ledger:
       host: <HOSTNAME>
       port: <PORT>
       access-token-file: <PATH TO ACCESS TOKEN FILE>

The ``daml deploy`` command will

#. upload the project's compiled DAR file to the ledger. This will make the Daml templates defined
   in the current project available to the API users of the sandbox.

#. allocate the parties specified in the project's ``daml.yaml`` on the ledger if they are missing.

For additional interactions with the ledger, use the ``daml ledger`` command. Try running ``daml
ledger --help`` to get a list of available ledger commands:

.. code-block:: none

   $ daml ledger --help
   Usage: daml ledger COMMAND
     Interact with a remote Daml ledger. You can specify the ledger in daml.yaml
     with the ledger.host and ledger.port options, or you can pass the --host and
     --port flags to each command below. If the ledger is authenticated, you should
     pass the name of the file containing the token using the --access-token-file
     flag or the `ledger.access-token-file` field in daml.yaml.

   Available options:
     -h,--help                Show this help text

   Available commands:
     list-parties             List parties known to ledger
     allocate-parties         Allocate parties on ledger
     upload-dar               Upload DAR file to ledger
     navigator                Launch Navigator on ledger

Connecting via TLS
------------------

To connect to the ledger via TLS, pass ``--tls`` to the
various commands. If your ledger supports or requires mutual
authentication you can pass your client key and certificate chain
files via ``--pem client_key.pem --crt client.crt``. Finally, you can
use a custom certificate authority for validating the server
certificate by passing ``--cacrt server.crt``. If ``--pem``, ``--crt``
or ``--cacrt`` are specified TLS is enabled automatically so ``--tls``
is redundant.

Configuring Request Timeouts
----------------------------

You can configure the timeout used on API requests by passing
``--timeout=N`` to the various ``daml ledger`` commands and ``daml
deploy`` which will set the timeout to N seconds. Note that this is a
per-request timeout not a timeout for the whole command. That matters
for commands like ``daml deploy`` that consist of multiple requests.
