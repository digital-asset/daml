Deploying to DAML ledgers
*************************

To run a DAML application, you'll need to deploy it to a DAML ledger.

How to deploy
=============

You can deploy to:

- The Sandbox with persistence. For information on how to do this, see the section on persistence in :doc:`/tools/sandbox` docs
- Further deployment options which are in development. For information on these options and their stage of development, see the table below.

DAML ledgers built or in development
====================================

The following table lists the ledgers that support DAML, or are implementing
support for running DAML.

.. note: the table renderer fails *silently* if you don't have the right
   number of columns!
