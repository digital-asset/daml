===============

The DA ledger model defines:

  #. what the ledger looks like - the structure of DA ledgers
  #. who can request which changes - the integrity model for DA ledgers
  #. who sees which changes and data - the privacy model for DA ledgers

The below sections review these concepts of the ledger model in turn.
They also briefly describe the link between DAML and the model.
