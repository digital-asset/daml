-- | This module tests the case where a class method contains a constraint
-- not present in the class itself.
module ConstrainedClassMethod where

class A t where
    foo : t -> t
    bar : Eq t => t -> t

-- This would create a recursive type synonym.
-- For now, we do not support this. As a workaround
-- you can do manual dictionary passing.
-- class B t where
--    baz : B b => b -> t
