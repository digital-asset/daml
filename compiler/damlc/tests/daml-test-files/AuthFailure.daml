module AuthFailure where

import Daml.Script

-- Tests for various(all) different forms of authorization failure detected during execution.
-- Three kinds of authorization failure are tested here.
-- Three others (NoSignatories, NoControllers) are tested in separate files, because the expected
-- error message doesn't contain any indication of which testcase causes it.
-- Two others are tested in AuthFailureWithKey, because keys are only supported in dev.
