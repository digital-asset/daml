# This is a gross hack: ghc-pkg is linked dynamically so to distribute
# it we have to throw it at package_app. However, the result of that
# is a tarball so if we try to add that to resources `bazel run` is
# not going to work. We thus use the dynamically linked executable in the runfiles of damlc
# and the tarball produced by package_app in the resources of damlc-dist.
