## START Bazel-mandated setup

# Bazel is unable to provide a sensible runtime environment for test scripts
# on Windows, so it requires the script to jump through these hoops. Bazel
# provides a function, rlocation, that the bash script can use to locate its
# dependencies using the same path syntax as in Bazel rules, except in a
# restricted (but not really documented) way. For some reason that function
# needs to be imported using the massive block of code below, rather than just
# have an env var that points to a single file that sets it up, as in `source
# $RUNFILES_LIB`.

# Assigns "unset" to RUNFILES_DIR only if it does not already have a value, so
# we do not crash if it is not set.
: ${RUNFILES_DIR:=unset}

# Use the Bazel-provided "source $RUNFILES_LIB" block only if we are running
# under Bazel, so the script can also be invoked manually by just running
# `./ci-tests.sh`.
if [[ "$RUNFILES_DIR" != "unset" ]]; then
    # --- begin runfiles.bash initialization v2 ---
    # Copy-pasted from the Bazel Bash runfiles library v2.

    # Because path handling is too different between platforms, when running
    # under Bazel, we assume we get all the paths as arguments, rather than
    # trying to do globbing in this script. The first argument is expected to
    # be the path to the jq binary, and all the others are JSON files we need
    # to check.

    # provides a `TEST_WORKSPACE` variable. The documentation for
    # runfiles.bash, such as it is, says the argument to rlocation is
    # `my_workspace/path/to/my/data.txt`, so you'd think calling e.g.
    # `$(rlocation jq_dev_env/bin/jq` would work. And it does on Linux and
    # macOS, but Windows seems to require the use of `TEST_WORKSPACE`.
    # Unhelpfully, on Windows, this failure is completely silent and the call
    # to `rlocation` just returns an empty string.

    # `$@` as ARGV, think of `$#` as ARGC. Except they are both variables and
    # get updated by `shift` accordingly. Bash integer logic `(( n )))` will
    # consider `0` as false and everything else as true (as opposed to normal
    # shell boolean test which considers 0 as true and the rest as false, as it
    # handles error codes).
