      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                             Version 2.0, January 2004
                          http://www.apache.org/licenses/
  
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this
  document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized
  by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
  common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
  the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
  entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making
  modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
  Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
  the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
  modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
  purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
  remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
  interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or
  additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
  owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
  behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
  "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
  sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
  limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
  systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
  the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
  but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
  otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
  Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
  Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
  and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
  of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
  the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
  made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
  Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
  You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
  direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
  must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
  distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
  or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
  contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
  alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
  and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
  with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
  otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
  Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
  of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
  modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
  executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
  trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
  Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in
  describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
  file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
  the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
  any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
  License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
  grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
  be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
  a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
  indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
  this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
  only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
  behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
  reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
        identification within third-party archives.

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this
  document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized
  by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
  common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
  the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
  entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making
  modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
  Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
  the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
  modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
  purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
  remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
  interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or
  additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
  owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
  behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
  "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
  sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
  limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
  systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
  the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
  but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
  otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
  Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
  Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
  and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
  of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
  the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
  made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
  Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
  You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
  direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
  must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
  distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
  or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
  contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
  alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
  and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
  with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
  otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
  Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
  of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
  modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
  executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
  trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
  Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in
  describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
  file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
  the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
  any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
  License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
  grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
  be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
  a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
  indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
  this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
  only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
  behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
  reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
        identification within third-party archives.

  performance,
  standard-compliant [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-
  international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)

  international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm))
  - Sensible [syntax tree
  format](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/spec.md) as
  standardized by [ESTree project](https://github.com/estree/estree)
  - Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-
  column)
  - [Heavily tested](http://esprima.org/test/ci.html) (~1250 [unit
  tests](https://github.com/jquery/esprima/tree/master/test/fixtures)
  with [full code coverage](https://codecov.io/github/jquery/esprima))
  
  Esprima serves as a **building block** for some JavaScript
  language tools, from [code
  instrumentation](http://esprima.org/demo/functiontrace.html)
  to [editor autocompletion](http://esprima.org/demo/autocomplete.html).
  
  Esprima runs on many popular web browsers, as well as other ECMAScript
  platforms such as
  [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino),
  [Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/), and

grunt-contrib-connect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `grunt-contrib-connect@1.0.2 <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # grunt-contrib-connect v1.0.2 [![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-
  ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect.svg?branch=master)](https
  ://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) [![Build Status: Windo
  ws](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3bp93hbs2rd5lwfd/branc
  h/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-
  contrib-connect/branch/master)
  
  > Start a connect web server
  
  
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to
  check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
  guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com
  /sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once
  you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with
  this command:
  
  ```shell
  npm install grunt-contrib-connect --save-dev
  ```
  
  Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your
  Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:
  
  ```js
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-connect');
  ```
  
  
  
  
  ## Connect task
  _Run this task with the `grunt connect` command._
  
  Note that this server only runs as long as grunt is running. Once
  grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This behavior can
  be changed with the [keepalive](#keepalive) option, and can be enabled
  ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt connect:keepalive`.
  
  This task was designed to be used in conjunction with another task
  that is run immediately afterwards, like the [grunt-contrib-qunit
  plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit) `qunit` task.
  ### Options
  
  #### port
  Type: `Integer`
  Default: `8000`
  
  The port on which the webserver will respond. The task will fail if
  the specified port is already in use (unless
  [useAvailablePort](#useavailableport) is set). You can use the special
  values `0` or `'?'` to use a system-assigned port.
  
  #### protocol
  Type: `String`
  Default: `'http'`
  
  May be `'http'`, `'http2'` or `'https'`.
  
  #### hostname
  Type: `String`
  Default: `'0.0.0.0'`
  
  The hostname on which the webserver can be accessed.
  
  Setting it to `'*'`, like '`0.0.0.0`', will make the server accessible
  from any **local** IPv4 address like  `'127.0.0.1'` and the IP
  assigned to an ethernet or wireless interface (like `'192.168.0.x'` or
  `'10.0.0.x'`). [More info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0)
  
  If [`open`](#open) is set to `true`, the `hostname` setting will be
  used to generate the URL that is opened by the browser, defaulting to
  `localhost` if a wildcard hostname was specified.
  
  #### base
  Type: `String` or `Array` or `Object`
  Default: `'.'`
  
  | Type     | Result
  | Example                                              |
  | ---      | :---
  | ---                                                  |
  | *String* | The base (or root) directory from which files will be
  served. Defaults to the project Gruntfile's directory.
  | `'public'`                                           |
  | *Array*  | Array of `String` (or `Object`) bases to serve multiple
  directories. The last base given will be the [directory][] to become
  browse-able.        | `['public','www-root']`
  |
  | *Object* | Map containing `path` and `options` keys. `options` are
  passed on to the [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-
  static) module. | `{ path: 'public', options: { maxAge: 1000*60*5 } }`
  |
  
  
  #### directory
  Type: `String`
  Default: `null`
  
  Set to the directory you wish to be browse-able. Used to override the
  `base` option browse-able directory.
  
  See https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-index for details.
  
  #### keepalive
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  Keep the server alive indefinitely. Note that if this option is
  enabled, any tasks specified after this task will _never run_. By
  default, once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This
  option changes that behavior.
  
  This option can also be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt
  connect:targetname:keepalive`
  
  #### debug
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  Set the `debug` option to true to enable logging instead of using the
  `--debug` flag.
  
  #### livereload
  Type: `Boolean` or `Number`
  Default: `false`
  
  Set to `true` or a port number to inject a live reload script tag into
  your page using [connect-livereload](https://github.com/intesso
  /connect-livereload).
  
  *This does not perform live reloading. It is intended to be used in
  tandem with grunt-contrib-watch or another task that will trigger a
  live reload server upon files changing.*
  
  #### open
  Type: `Boolean` or `String` or `Object`
  Default: `false`
  
  Open the served page in your default browser.
  
  This can be one of the following:
  
  - Specifying `true` opens the default server URL (generated from the
  [`protocol`](#protocol), [`hostname`](#hostname) and [`port`](#port)
  settings)
  - Specifying a URL opens that URL
  - Specify an object with the following keys to configure
  [open](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open) directly:
  
          ```js
          {
            target: 'http://localhost:8000', // target url to open
            appName: 'open', // name of the app that opens, ie: open,
  start, xdg-open
            callback: function() {} // called when the app has opened
          }
          ```
  
  #### useAvailablePort
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  If `true` the task will look for the next available port after the set
  `port` option.
  
  #### onCreateServer
  Type: `Function` or `Array`
  Default: `null`
  
  A function to be called after the server object is created, to allow
  integrating libraries that need access to connect's server object. A
  Socket.IO example:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          port: 8000,
          hostname: '*',
          onCreateServer: function(server, connect, options) {
            var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
            io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket) {
              // do something with socket
            });
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  
  #### middleware
  Type: `Function` or `Array`
  Default: `Array` of connect middlewares that use `options.base` for
  static files and directory browsing
  
  As an `Array`:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          middleware: [
            function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
              res.end('Hello, world!');
            }
          ],
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  As a `function`:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          middleware: function(connect, options, middlewares) {
            // inject a custom middleware into the array of default
  middlewares
            middlewares.unshift(function(req, res, next) {
              if (req.url !== '/hello/world') return next();
  
              res.end('Hello, world from port #' + options.port + '!');
            });
  
            return middlewares;
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  Lets you add in your own Connect middlewares. This option expects a
  function that returns an array of middlewares. See the [project
  Gruntfile][] and [project unit tests][] for a usage example.
  
  [project Gruntfile]: Gruntfile.js
  [project unit tests]: test/connect_test.js
  
  ### Usage examples
  
  #### Basic Use
  In this example, `grunt connect` (or more verbosely, `grunt
  connect:server`) will start a static web server at
  `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root`
  directory relative to the gruntfile, and any tasks run afterwards will
  be able to access it.
  
  ```js
  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          port: 9001,
          base: 'www-root'
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  
  If you want your web server to use the default options, just omit the
  `options` object. You still need to specify a target (`uses_defaults`
  in this example), but the target's configuration object can otherwise
  be empty or nonexistent. In this example, `grunt connect` (or more
  verbosely, `grunt connect:uses_defaults`) will start a static web
  server using the default options.
  
  ```js
  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      uses_defaults: {}
    }
  });
  ```
  
  #### Multiple Servers
  You can specify multiple servers to be run alone or simultaneously by
  creating a target for each server. In this example, running either
  `grunt connect:site1` or `grunt connect:site2` will  start the
  appropriate web server, but running `grunt connect` will run _both_.
  Note that any server for which the [keepalive](#keepalive) option is
  specified will prevent _any_ task or target from running after it.
  
  ```js
  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      site1: {
        options: {
          port: 9000,
          base: 'www-roots/site1'
        }
      },
      site2: {
        options: {
          port: 9001,
          base: 'www-roots/site2'
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  
  #### Static Options
  
  Options for the serve-static module. See [serve-
  static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static):
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          port: 8000,
          base: {
            path: 'www-root',
            options: {
              index: 'somedoc.html',
              maxAge: 300000
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  
  
  
  ####
  
  #### Roll Your Own
  Like the [Basic Use](#basic-use) example, this example will start a
  static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set
  to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile. Unlike the
  other example, this is done by creating a brand new task. in fact,
  this plugin isn't even installed!
  
  ```js
  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({ /* Nothing needed here! */ });
  
  // After running "npm install connect serve-static --save-dev" to add
  connect as a dev
  // dependency of your project, you can require it in your gruntfile
  with:
  var connect = require('connect');
  var serveStatic = require('serve-static');
  connect(serveStatic('www-root')).listen(9001);
  
  // Now you can define a "connect" task that starts a webserver, using
  the
  // connect lib, with whatever options and configuration you need:
  grunt.registerTask('connect', 'Start a custom static web server.',
  function() {
    grunt.log.writeln('Starting static web server in "www-root" on port
  9001.');
    connect(serveStatic('www-root')).listen(9001);
  });
  ```
  
  #### Support for HTTPS / HTTP2
  
  A default certificate authority, certificate and key file are provided
  and pre-
  configured for use when `protocol` has been set to `https`.
  
  NOTE: No passphrase set for the certificate.
  If you are getting warnings in Google Chrome, add 'server.crt' (from
  'node_modules/tasks/certs')
  to your keychain.
  In OS X, after you add 'server.crt', right click on the certificate,
  select 'Get Info' - 'Trust' - 'Always Trust', close window, restart
  Chrome.
  
  For HTTPS / HTTP2 livereload with [grunt-contrib-
  watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
   see the last example [here](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-
  watch#optionslivereload).
  
  ###### Advanced HTTPS / HTTP2 config
  
  If the default certificate setup is unsuitable for your environment,
  OpenSSL
  can be used to create a set of self-signed certificates with a local
  ca root.
  
  ```shell
  ### Create ca.key, use a password phrase when asked
  ### When asked 'Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:' use
  your hostname, i.e 'mysite.dev'
  openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 1024
  openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -out ca.crt -signkey ca.key
  
  ### Create server certificate
  openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
  openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
  
  ### Remove password from the certificate
  cp server.key server.key.org
  openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
  
  ### Generate self-siged certificate
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out
  server.crt
  ```

  configuring SSL,

  Grunt configuration would become
  
  ```js
  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    connect: {
      server: {
        options: {
          protocol: 'https', // or 'http2'
          port: 8443,
          key: grunt.file.read('server.key').toString(),
          cert: grunt.file.read('server.crt').toString(),
          ca: grunt.file.read('ca.crt').toString()
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  [TLS]: http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createserver_options_sec
  ureconnectionlistener
  
  #### Grunt Events
  The connect plugin will emit a grunt event,
  `connect.{taskName}.listening`, once the server has started. You can
  listen for this event to run things against a keepalive server, for
  example:
  
  ```js
  grunt.registerTask('jasmine-server', 'start web server for jasmine
  tests in browser', function() {
    grunt.task.run('jasmine:tests:build');
  
    grunt.event.once('connect.tests.listening', function(host, port) {
      var specRunnerUrl = 'http://' + host + ':' + port +
  '/_SpecRunner.html';
      grunt.log.writeln('Jasmine specs available at: ' + specRunnerUrl);
      require('open')(specRunnerUrl);
    });
  
    grunt.task.run('connect:tests:keepalive');
  });
  ```

grunt-contrib-copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `grunt-contrib-copy@1.0.0 <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # grunt-contrib-copy v1.0.0 [![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-
  ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-
  ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy) [![Build Status: Windows](https://c
  i.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/fe6l517l01ys2y86/branch/master?svg=
  true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-
  copy/branch/master)
  
  > Copy files and folders
  
  
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to
  check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
  guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com
  /sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once
  you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with
  this command:
  
  ```shell
  npm install grunt-contrib-copy --save-dev
  ```
  
  Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your
  Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:
  
  ```js
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-copy');
  ```
  
  *This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still
  using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you
  upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4), but in case
  you can't please use [v0.3.2](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-
  contrib-copy/tree/grunt-0.3-stable).*
  
  
  
  ## Copy task
  _Run this task with the `grunt copy` command._
  
  Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the
  grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
  ### Options
  
  #### process
  Type: `Function(content, srcpath)`
  
  This option is passed to `grunt.file.copy` as an advanced way to
  control the file contents that are copied.
  
  *`processContent` has been renamed to `process` and the option name
  will be removed in the future.*
  
  #### noProcess
  Type: `String`
  
  This option is passed to `grunt.file.copy` as an advanced way to
  control which file contents are processed.
  
  *`processContentExclude` has been renamed to `noProcess` and the
  option name will be removed in the future.*
  
  #### encoding
  Type: `String`
  Default: `grunt.file.defaultEncoding`
  
  The file encoding to copy files with.
  
  #### mode
  Type: `Boolean` or `String`
  Default: `false`
  
  Whether to copy or set the destination file and directory permissions.
  Set to `true` to copy the existing file and directories permissions.
  Or set to the mode, i.e.: `0644`, that copied files will be set to.
  
  #### timestamp
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  Whether to preserve the timestamp attributes(`atime` and `mtime`) when
  copying files. Set to `true` to preserve files timestamp. But
  timestamp will *not* be preserved when the file contents or name are
  changed during copying.
  
  ### Usage Examples
  
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      files: [
        // includes files within path
        {expand: true, src: ['path/*'], dest: 'dest/', filter:
  'isFile'},
  
        // includes files within path and its sub-directories
        {expand: true, src: ['path/**'], dest: 'dest/'},
  
        // makes all src relative to cwd
        {expand: true, cwd: 'path/', src: ['**'], dest: 'dest/'},
  
        // flattens results to a single level
        {expand: true, flatten: true, src: ['path/**'], dest: 'dest/',
  filter: 'isFile'},
      ],
    },
  },
  ```
  
  This task supports all the file mapping format Grunt supports. Please
  read [Globbing patterns](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks
  #globbing-patterns) and [Building the files object
  dynamically](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-
  object-dynamically) for additional details.
  
  Here are some additional examples, given the following file tree:
  ```shell
  $ tree -I node_modules
  .
  ├── Gruntfile.js
  └── src
      ├── a
      └── subdir
          └── b
  
  2 directories, 3 files
  ```
  
  **Copy a single file tree:**
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      expand: true,
      src: 'src/*',
      dest: 'dest/',
    },
  },
  ```
  
  ```shell
  $ grunt copy
  Running "copy:main" (copy) task
  Created 1 directories, copied 1 files
  
  Done, without errors.
  $ tree -I node_modules
  .
  ├── Gruntfile.js
  ├── dest
  │   └── src
  │       ├── a
  │       └── subdir
  └── src
      ├── a
      └── subdir
          └── b
  
  5 directories, 4 files
  ```
  
  **Copying without full path:**
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'src',
      src: '**',
      dest: 'dest/',
    },
  },
  ```
  
  ```shell
  $ grunt copy
  Running "copy:main" (copy) task
  Created 2 directories, copied 2 files
  
  Done, without errors.
  $ tree -I node_modules
  .
  ├── Gruntfile.js
  ├── dest
  │   ├── a
  │   └── subdir
  │       └── b
  └── src
      ├── a
      └── subdir
          └── b
  
  5 directories, 5 files
  ```
  
  **Flattening the filepath output:**
  
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'src/',
      src: '**',
      dest: 'dest/',
      flatten: true,
      filter: 'isFile',
    },
  },
  ```
  
  ```shell
  $ grunt copy
  Running "copy:main" (copy) task
  Copied 2 files
  
  Done, without errors.
  $ tree -I node_modules
  .
  ├── Gruntfile.js
  ├── dest
  │   ├── a
  │   └── b
  └── src
      ├── a
      └── subdir
          └── b
  
  3 directories, 5 files
  ```
  
  
  **Copy and modify a file:**
  
  To change the contents of a file as it is copied, set an
  `options.process` function as follows:
  
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      src: 'src/a',
      dest: 'src/a.bak',
      options: {
        process: function (content, srcpath) {
          return content.replace(/[sad ]/g,"_");
        },
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  Here all occurrences of the letters "s", "a" and "d", as well as all
  spaces, will be changed to underlines in "a.bak". Of course, you are
  not limited to just using regex replacements.
  
  To process all files in a directory, the `process` function is used in
  exactly the same way.
  
  NOTE: If `process` is not working, be aware it was called
  `processContent` in v0.4.1 and earlier.
  
  
  ##### Troubleshooting
  
  By default, if a file or directory is not found it is quietly ignored.
  If the file should exist, and non-existence generate an error, then
  add `nonull:true`. For instance, this Gruntfile.js entry:
  
  ```js
  copy: {
    main: {
      nonull: true,
      src: 'not-there',
      dest: 'create-me',
    },
  },
  ```
  
  gives this output:
  
  ```shell
  $ grunt copy
  Running "copy:main" (copy) task
  Warning: Unable to read "not-there" file (Error code: ENOENT). Use
  --force to continue.
  
  Aborted due to warnings.
  ```

  ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-

  =true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-

  > Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added,
  changed or deleted
  
  
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to
  check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
  guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com
  /sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once
  you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with
  this command:
  
  ```shell
  npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
  ```
  
  Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your
  Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:
  
  ```js
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
  ```
  
  
  
  
  ## Watch task
  _Run this task with the `grunt watch` command._
  
  
  ### Settings
  
  There are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch
  options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as
  some additional options as follows:
  
  #### files
  Type: `String|Array`
  
  This defines what file patterns this task will watch. It can be a
  string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.
  
  #### tasks
  Type: `String|Array`
  
  This defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.
  
  #### options.spawn
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `true`
  
  Whether to spawn task runs in a child process. Setting this option to
  `false` speeds up the reaction time of the watch (usually 500ms faster
  for most) and allows subsequent task runs to share the same context.
  Not spawning task runs can make the watch more prone to failing so
  please use as needed.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: ['**/*.js'],
      tasks: ['jshint'],
      options: {
        spawn: false,
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  *For backwards compatibility the option `nospawn` is still available
  and will do the opposite of `spawn`.*
  
  #### options.interrupt
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  As files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child
  processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process
  per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt`
  option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one
  upon later changes.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: '**/*.js',
      tasks: ['jshint'],
      options: {
        interrupt: true,
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  #### options.debounceDelay
  Type: `Integer`
  Default: `500`
  
  How long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same
  filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntfile.js` file was
  `changed`, a `changed` event will only fire again after the given
  milliseconds.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: '**/*.js',
      tasks: ['jshint'],
      options: {
        debounceDelay: 250,
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  #### options.interval
  Type: `Integer`
  Default: `100`
  
  The `interval` is passed to `fs.watchFile`. Since `interval` is only
  used by `fs.watchFile` and this watcher also uses `fs.watch`; it is
  recommended to ignore this option. *Default is 100ms*.
  
  #### options.event
  Type: `String|Array`
  Default: `'all'`
  
  Specify the type of watch events that triggers the specified task.
  This option can be one or many of: `'all'`, `'changed'`, `'added'` and
  `'deleted'`.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: '**/*.js',
      tasks: ['generateFileManifest'],
      options: {
        event: ['added', 'deleted'],
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  #### options.reload
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  By default, if `Gruntfile.js` is being watched, then changes to it
  will trigger the watch task to restart, and reload the `Gruntfile.js`
  changes.
  When `reload` is set to `true`, changes to *any* of the watched files
  will trigger the watch task to restart.
  This is especially useful if your `Gruntfile.js` is dependent on other
  files.
  
  ```js
  watch: {
    configFiles: {
      files: [ 'Gruntfile.js', 'config/*.js' ],
      options: {
        reload: true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  
  #### options.forever
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `true`
  
  This is *only a task level option* and cannot be configured per
  target. By default the watch task will duck punch `grunt.fatal` and
  `grunt.warn` to try and prevent them from exiting the watch process.
  If you don't want `grunt.fatal` and `grunt.warn` to be overridden set
  the `forever` option to `false`.
  
  #### options.dateFormat
  Type: `Function`
  
  This is *only a task level option* and cannot be configured per
  target. By default when the watch has finished running tasks it will
  display the message `Completed in 1.301s at Thu Jul 18 2013 14:58:21
  GMT-0700 (PDT) - Waiting...`. You can override this message by
  supplying your own function:
  
  ```js
  watch: {
    options: {
      dateFormat: function(time) {
        grunt.log.writeln('The watch finished in ' + time + 'ms at' +
  (new Date()).toString());
        grunt.log.writeln('Waiting for more changes...');
      },
    },
    scripts: {
      files: '**/*.js',
      tasks: 'jshint',
    },
  },
  ```
  
  #### options.atBegin
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `false`
  
  This option will trigger the run of each specified task at startup of
  the watcher.
  
  #### options.livereload
  Type: `Boolean|Number|Object`
  Default: `false`
  
  Set to `true` or set `livereload: 1337` to a port number to enable
  live reloading. Default and recommended port is `35729`.
  
  If enabled a live reload server will be started with the watch task
  per target. Then after the indicated tasks have run, the live reload
  server will be triggered with the modified files.
  
  See also how to [enable livereload on your
  HTML](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/blob/master/docs
  /watch-examples.md#enabling-live-reload-in-your-html).
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    css: {
      files: '**/*.sass',
      tasks: ['sass'],
      options: {
        livereload: true,
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  Passing an object to `livereload` allows listening on a specific port
  and hostname/IP or over https connections (by specifying `key` and
  `cert` paths).
  
  Example:
  ```js
  watch: {
    css: {
      files: '**/*.sass',
      tasks: ['sass'],
      options: {
        livereload: {
          host: 'localhost',
          port: 9000,
          key: grunt.file.read('path/to/ssl.key'),
          cert: grunt.file.read('path/to/ssl.crt')
          // you can pass in any other options you'd like to the https
  server, as listed here: http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_creates
  erver_options_secureconnectionlistener
        }
      },
    },
  },
  ```
  
  
  #### options.cwd
  Type: `String|Object`
  Default: `process.cwd()`
  
  Ability to set the current working directory. Defaults to
  `process.cwd()`. Can either be a string to set the cwd to match files
  and spawn tasks or an object to set each independently. Such as:
  ```js
  options: {
    cwd: {
      files: 'match/files/from/here',
      spawn: 'but/spawn/files/from/here'
    }
  }
  ```
  
  To strip off a path before emitting events:
  ```js
  options: {
    cwd: {
      files: 'a/path',
      event: 'a/path'
    }
  }
  ```
  This will strip off `a/path` before emitting events. This option is
  useful for specifying the base directory to use with livereload.
  
  
  #### options.livereloadOnError
  Type: `Boolean`
  Default: `true`
  
  Option to prevent the livereload if the executed tasks encountered an
  error. If set to `false`, the livereload will only be triggered if all
  tasks completed successfully.
  
  ### Examples
  
  ```js
  // Simple config to run jshint any time a file is added, changed or
  deleted
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      files: ['**/*'],
      tasks: ['jshint'],
    },
  });
  ```
  
  ```js
  // Advanced config. Run specific tasks when specific files are added,
  changed or deleted.
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      gruntfile: {
        files: 'Gruntfile.js',
        tasks: ['jshint:gruntfile'],
      },
      src: {
        files: ['lib/*.js', 'css/**/*.scss', '!lib/dontwatch.js'],
        tasks: ['default'],
      },
      test: {
        files: '<%= jshint.test.src %>',
        tasks: ['jshint:test', 'qunit'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  #### Using the `watch` event
  This task will emit a `watch` event when watched files are modified.
  This is useful if you would like a simple notification when files are
  edited or if you're using this task in tandem with another task. Here
  is a simple example using the `watch` event:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      scripts: {
        files: ['lib/*.js'],
      },
    },
  });
  grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath, target) {
    grunt.log.writeln(target + ': ' + filepath + ' has ' + action);
  });
  ```
  
  **The `watch` event is not intended for replacing the standard Grunt
  API for configuring and running tasks. If you're trying to run tasks
  from within the `watch` event you're more than likely doing it wrong.
  Please read [configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-
  tasks).**
  
  ##### Compiling Files As Needed
  A very common request is to only compile files as needed. Here is an
  example that will only lint changed files with the `jshint` task:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      scripts: {
        files: ['lib/*.js'],
        tasks: ['jshint'],
        options: {
          spawn: false,
        },
      },
    },
    jshint: {
      all: {
        src: ['lib/*.js'],
      },
    },
  });
  
  // On watch events configure jshint:all to only run on changed file
  grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {
    grunt.config('jshint.all.src', filepath);
  });
  ```
  
  If you need to dynamically modify your config, the `spawn` option must
  be disabled to keep the watch running under the same context.
  
  If you save multiple files simultaneously you may opt for a more
  robust method:
  
  ```js
  var changedFiles = Object.create(null);
  var onChange = grunt.util._.debounce(function() {
    grunt.config('jshint.all.src', Object.keys(changedFiles));
    changedFiles = Object.create(null);
  }, 200);
  grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {
    changedFiles[filepath] = action;
    onChange();
  });
  ```
  
  #### Live Reloading
  Live reloading is built into the watch task. Set the option
  `livereload` to `true` to enable on the default port `35729` or set to
  a custom port: `livereload: 1337`.
  
  The simplest way to add live reloading to all your watch targets is by
  setting `livereload` to `true` at the task level. This will run a
  single live reload server and trigger the live reload for all your
  watch targets:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      options: {
        livereload: true,
      },
      css: {
        files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],
        tasks: ['compass'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  You can also configure live reload for individual watch targets or run
  multiple live reload servers. Just be sure if you're starting multiple
  servers they operate on different ports:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    watch: {
      css: {
        files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],
        tasks: ['compass'],
        options: {
          // Start a live reload server on the default port 35729
          livereload: true,
        },
      },
      another: {
        files: ['lib/*.js'],
        tasks: ['anothertask'],
        options: {
          // Start another live reload server on port 1337
          livereload: 1337,
        },
      },
      dont: {
        files: ['other/stuff/*'],
        tasks: ['dostuff'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  ##### Enabling Live Reload in Your HTML
  Once you've started a live reload server you'll be able to access the
  live reload script. To enable live reload on your page, add a script
  tag before your closing `</body>` tag pointing to the `livereload.js`
  script:
  
  ```html
  <script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
  ```
  
  Feel free to add this script to your template situation and toggle
  with some sort of `dev` flag.
  
  ##### Using Live Reload with the Browser Extension
  Instead of adding a script tag to your page, you can live reload your
  page by installing a browser extension. Please visit [how do I install
  and use the browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowled
  gebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-
  extensions-) for help installing an extension for your browser.
  
  Once installed please use the default live reload port `35729` and the
  browser extension will automatically reload your page without needing
  the `<script>` tag.
  
  ##### Using Connect Middleware
  Since live reloading is used when developing, you may want to disable
  building for production (and are not using the browser extension). One
  method is to use Connect middleware to inject the script tag into your
  page. Try the [connect-livereload](https://github.com/intesso/connect-
  livereload) middleware for injecting the live reload script into your
  page.
  
  ##### Rolling Your Own Live Reload
  Live reloading is made easy by the library [tiny-
  lr](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr). It is encouraged to read the
  documentation for `tiny-lr`. If you would like to trigger the live
  reload server yourself, simply POST files to the URL:
  `http://localhost:35729/changed`. Or if you rather roll your own live
  reload implementation use the following example:
  
  ```js
  // Create a live reload server instance
  var lrserver = require('tiny-lr')();
  
  // Listen on port 35729
  lrserver.listen(35729, function(err) { console.log('LR Server
  Started'); });
  
  // Then later trigger files or POST to localhost:35729/changed
  lrserver.changed({body:{files:['public/css/changed.css']}});
  ```
  
  ##### Live Reload with Preprocessors
  Any time a watched file is edited with the `livereload` option
  enabled, the file will be sent to the live reload server. Some edited
  files you may desire to have sent to the live reload server, such as
  when preprocessing (`sass`, `less`, `coffeescript`, etc). As any file
  not recognized will reload the entire page as opposed to just the
  `css` or `javascript`.
  
  The solution is to point a `livereload` watch target to your
  destination files:
  
  ```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    sass: {
      dev: {
        src: ['src/sass/*.sass'],
        dest: 'dest/css/index.css',
      },
    },
    watch: {
      sass: {
        // We watch and compile sass files as normal but don't live
  reload here
        files: ['src/sass/*.sass'],
        tasks: ['sass'],
      },
      livereload: {
        // Here we watch the files the sass task will compile to
        // These files are sent to the live reload server after sass
  compiles to them
        options: { livereload: true },
        files: ['dest/**/*'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  
  ### FAQs
  
  #### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?
  This is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the
  default is very low (256). Temporarily increase your limit with
  `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the new max limit.
  
  In some versions of OSX the above solution doesn't work. In that case
  try `launchctl limit maxfiles 10480 10480 ` and restart your terminal.
  See [here](http://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-
  default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6).
  
  #### Can I use this with Grunt v0.3?
  `grunt-contrib-watch@0.1.x` is compatible with Grunt v0.3 but it is
  highly recommended to upgrade Grunt instead.
  
  #### Why is the watch devouring all my memory/cpu?
  Likely because of an enthusiastic pattern trying to watch thousands of
  files. Such as `'**/*.js'` but forgetting to exclude the
  `node_modules` folder with `'!**/node_modules/**'`. Try grouping your
  files within a subfolder or be more explicit with your file matching
  pattern.
  
  Another reason if you're watching a large number of files could be the
  low default `interval`. Try increasing with `options: { interval: 5007
  }`. Please see issues [#35](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-
  watch/issues/35) and [#145](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-
  watch/issues/145) for more information.
  
  #### Why spawn as child processes as a default?
  The goal of this watch task is as files are changed, run tasks as if
  they were triggered by the user himself or herself. Each time a user
  runs `grunt` a process is spawned and tasks are ran in succession. In
  an effort to keep the experience consistent and continually produce
  expected results, this watch task spawns tasks as child processes by
  default.
  
  Sandboxing task runs also allows this watch task to run more stable
  over long periods of time. As well as more efficiently with more
  complex tasks and file structures.
  
  Spawning does cause a performance hit (usually 500ms for most
  environments). It also cripples tasks that rely on the watch task to
  share the context with each subsequent run (i.e., reload tasks). If
  you would like a faster watch task or need to share the context please
  set the `spawn` option to `false`. Just be aware that with this option
  enabled, the watch task is more prone to failure.
  
  #### How can I have the browser reload for files listed in a task?
  Instead of restarting your server each time a static file is changed,
  start a static web server using (grunt-contrib-
  connect)[https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect].
  
  You'll have the `connect` web server on seperate port ex: port 9000
  from your main server. When the 'livereload' option is enabled for
  'watch' tasks, it will handle triggerring the live reload server for
  each tasks and when files are modified, which then server back to main
  server ex: 3000. The main server must include a script tag or a
  browser extension to the livereload server in order for the browser
  automatically.

  jsonify
  =======
  
  This module provides Douglas Crockford's JSON implementation without
  modifying
  any globals.
  
  `stringify` and `parse` are merely exported without respect to whether
  or not a
  global `JSON` object exists.
  
  methods
  =======
  
  var json = require('jsonify');
  
  json.parse(source, reviver)
  ---------------------------
  
  Return a new javascript object from a parse of the `source` string.
  
  If a `reviver` function is specified, walk the structure passing each
  name/value
  pair to `reviver.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value`
  before
  parsing it.
  
  json.stringify(value, replacer, space)
  --------------------------------------
  
  Return a string representation for `value`.
  
  If `replacer` is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value
  pair to
  `replacer.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before
  stringifying
  it.
  
  If `space` is a number, indent the result by that many spaces.
  If `space` is a string, use `space` as the indentation.

minipass
^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `minipass@2.2.4 <https://github.com/isaacs/minipass>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # minipass
  
  A _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough
  stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthr
  ough)
  
  [It's very fast for objects, strings, and buffers.
  
  Supports pipe()ing (including multi-pipe() and backpressure
  transmission), buffering data until either a `data` event handler or
  `pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first chunk), and most other
  cases where PassThrough is a good idea.
  
  There is a `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to consume
  data from this stream via `'data'` events or by calling `pipe()` into
  some other stream.  Calling `read()` requires the buffer to be
  flattened in some cases, which requires copying memory.  Also,
  `read()` always returns Buffers, even if an `encoding` option is
  specified.
  
  There is also no `unpipe()` method.  Once you start piping, there is
  no stopping it!
  
  If you set `objectMode: true` in the options, then whatever is written
  will be emitted.  Otherwise, it'll do a minimal amount of Buffer
  copying to ensure proper Streams semantics when `read(n)` is called.
  
  This is not a `through` or `through2` stream.  It doesn't transform
  the data, it just passes it right through.  If you want to transform
  the data, extend the class, and override the `write()` method.  Once
  you're done transforming the data however you want, call
  `super.write()` with the transform output.
  
  For an example of a stream that extends MiniPass to provide transform
  capabilities, check out [minizlib](http://npm.im/minizlib).
  
  ## USAGE
  
  ```js
  const MiniPass = require('minipass')
  const mp = new MiniPass(options) // optional: { encoding }
  mp.write('foo')
  mp.pipe(someOtherStream)
  mp.end('bar')
  ```

npm-bundled
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `npm-bundled@1.0.3 <https://github.com/npm/npm-bundled>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # npm-bundled
  
  Run this in a node package, and it'll tell you which things in
  node_modules are bundledDependencies, or transitive dependencies of
  bundled dependencies.
  
  ## USAGE
  
  To get the list of deps at the top level that are bundled (or
  transitive deps of a bundled dep) run this:
  
  ```js
  const bundled = require('npm-bundled')
  
  // async version
  bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}, (er, list) => {
    // er means it had an error, which is _hella_ weird
    // list is a list of package names, like `fooblz` or `@corp/blerg`
    // the might not all be deps of the top level, because transitives
  })
  
  // async promise version
  bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}).then(list => {
    // so promisey!
    // actually the callback version returns a promise, too, it just
    // attaches the supplied callback to the promise
  })
  
  // sync version, throws if there's an error
  const list = bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'})
  ```
  
  That's basically all you need to know.  If you care to dig into it,
  you can also use the `bundled.Walker` and `bundled.WalkerSync`
  classes to get fancy.
  
  This library does not write anything to the filesystem, but it _may_
  have undefined behavior if the structure of `node_modules` changes
  while it's reading deps.
  
  All symlinks are followed.  This means that it can lead to surprising
  results if a symlinked bundled dependency has a missing dependency
  that is satisfied at the top level.  Since package creation resolves
  symlinks as well, this is an edge case where package creation and
  development environment are not going to be aligned, and is best
  avoided.

rc
^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `rc@1.2.7 <https://github.com/dominictarr/rc>`_
* `rc@1.2.8 <https://github.com/dominictarr/rc>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # rc
  
  The non-configurable configuration loader for lazy people.
  
  ## Usage
  
  The only option is to pass rc the name of your app, and your default
  configuration.
  
  ```javascript
  var conf = require('rc')(appname, {
    //defaults go here.
    port: 2468,
  
    //defaults which are objects will be merged, not replaced
    views: {
      engine: 'jade'
    }
  });
  ```
  
  `rc` will return your configuration options merged with the defaults
  you specify.
  If you pass in a predefined defaults object, it will be mutated:
  
  ```javascript
  var conf = {};
  require('rc')(appname, conf);
  ```
  
  If `rc` finds any config files for your app, the returned config
  object will have
  a `configs` array containing their paths:
  
  ```javascript
  var appCfg = require('rc')(appname, conf);
  appCfg.configs[0] // /etc/appnamerc
  appCfg.configs[1] // /home/dominictarr/.config/appname
  appCfg.config // same as appCfg.configs[appCfg.configs.length - 1]
  ```
  
  ## Standards
  
  Given your application name (`appname`), rc will look in all the
  obvious places for configuration.
  
    * command line arguments, parsed by minimist _(e.g. `--foo baz`,
  also nested: `--foo.bar=baz`)_
    * environment variables prefixed with `${appname}_`
      * or use "\_\_" to indicate nested properties <br/> _(e.g.
  `appname_foo__bar__baz` => `foo.bar.baz`)_
    * if you passed an option `--config file` then from that file
    * a local `.${appname}rc` or the first found looking in `./ ../
  ../../ ../../../` etc.
    * `$HOME/.${appname}rc`
    * `$HOME/.${appname}/config`
    * `$HOME/.config/${appname}`
    * `$HOME/.config/${appname}/config`
    * `/etc/${appname}rc`
    * `/etc/${appname}/config`
    * the defaults object you passed in.
  
  All configuration sources that were found will be flattened into one
  object,
  so that sources **earlier** in this list override later ones.
  
  
  ## Configuration File Formats
  
  Configuration files (e.g. `.appnamerc`) may be in either
  [json](http://json.org/example) or
  [ini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format. **No** file
  extension (`.json` or `.ini`) should be used. The example
  configurations below are equivalent:
  
  
  #### Formatted as `ini`
  
  ```
  ; You can include comments in `ini` format if you want.
  
  dependsOn=0.10.0
  
  
  ; `rc` has built-in support for ini sections, see?
  
  [commands]
    www     = ./commands/www
    console = ./commands/repl
  
  
  ; You can even do nested sections
  
  [generators.options]
    engine  = ejs
  
  [generators.modules]
    new     = generate-new
    engine  = generate-backend
  
  ```
  
  #### Formatted as `json`
  
  ```javascript
  {
    // You can even comment your JSON, if you want
    "dependsOn": "0.10.0",
    "commands": {
      "www": "./commands/www",
      "console": "./commands/repl"
    },
    "generators": {
      "options": {
        "engine": "ejs"
      },
      "modules": {
        "new": "generate-new",
        "backend": "generate-backend"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  Comments are stripped from JSON config via [strip-json-
  comments](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments).
  
  > Since ini, and env variables do not have a standard for types, your
  application needs be prepared for strings.
  
  To ensure that string representations of booleans and numbers are
  always converted into their proper types (especially useful if you
  intend to do strict `===` comparisons), consider using a module such
  as [parse-strings-in-object](https://github.com/anselanza/parse-
  strings-in-object) to wrap the config object returned from rc.
  
  
  ## Simple example demonstrating precedence
  Assume you have an application like this (notice the hard-coded
  defaults passed to rc):
  ```
  const conf = require('rc')('myapp', {
      port: 12345,
      mode: 'test'
  });
  
  console.log(JSON.stringify(conf, null, 2));
  ```
  You also have a file `config.json`, with these contents:
  ```
  {
    "port": 9000,
    "foo": "from config json",
    "something": "else"
  }
  ```
  And a file `.myapprc` in the same folder, with these contents:
  ```
  {
    "port": "3001",
    "foo": "bar"
  }
  ```
  Here is the expected output from various commands:
  
  `node .`
  ```
  {
    "port": "3001",
    "mode": "test",
    "foo": "bar",
    "_": [],
    "configs": [
      "/Users/stephen/repos/conftest/.myapprc"
    ],
    "config": "/Users/stephen/repos/conftest/.myapprc"
  }
  ```
  *Default `mode` from hard-coded object is retained, but port is
  overridden by `.myapprc` file (automatically found based on appname
  match), and `foo` is added.*
  
  
  `node . --foo baz`
  ```
  {
    "port": "3001",
    "mode": "test",
    "foo": "baz",
    "_": [],
    "configs": [
      "/Users/stephen/repos/conftest/.myapprc"
    ],
    "config": "/Users/stephen/repos/conftest/.myapprc"
  }
  ```
  *Same result as above but `foo` is overridden because command-line
  arguments take precedence over `.myapprc` file.*
  
  `node . --foo barbar --config config.json`
  ```
  {
    "port": 9000,
    "mode": "test",
    "foo": "barbar",
    "something": "else",
    "_": [],
    "config": "config.json",
    "configs": [
      "/Users/stephen/repos/conftest/.myapprc",
      "config.json"
    ]
  }
  ```
  *Now the `port` comes from the `config.json` file specified
  (overriding the value from `.myapprc`), and `foo` value is overriden
  by command-line despite also being specified in the `config.json`
  file.*
  
  
  
  ## Advanced Usage
  
  #### Pass in your own `argv`
  
  You may pass in your own `argv` as the third argument to `rc`.  This
  is in case you want to [use your own command-line opts
  parser](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc/pull/12).
  
  ```javascript
  require('rc')(appname, defaults, customArgvParser);
  ```
  
  ## Pass in your own parser
  
  If you have a special need to use a non-standard parser,
  you can do so by passing in the parser as the 4th argument.
  (leave the 3rd as null to get the default args parser)
  
  ```javascript
  require('rc')(appname, defaults, null, parser);
  ```
  
  This may also be used to force a more strict format,
  such as strict, valid JSON only.
  
  ## Note on Performance
  
  `rc` is running `fs.statSync`-- so make sure you don't use it in a hot
  code path (e.g. a request handler)

  # slash [![Build Status](https://travis-
  ci.org/sindresorhus/slash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-
  ci.org/sindresorhus/slash)
  
  > Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔
  `foo/bar`
  
  [Forward-slash paths can be used in
  Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not
  extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.
  
  This was created since the `path` methods in Node outputs `\\` paths
  on Windows.
  
  
  ## Install
  
  ```sh
  $ npm install --save slash
  ```
  
  
  ## Usage
  
  ```js
  var path = require('path');
  var slash = require('slash');
  
  var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
  // Unix    => foo/bar
  // Windows => foo\\bar
  
  slash(str);
  // Unix    => foo/bar
  // Windows => foo/bar
  ```
  
  
  ## API
  
  ### slash(path)
  
  Type: `string`
  
  Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.

        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
  Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
  the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
  modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
  purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
  remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
  interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or

  Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
  Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
  and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
  of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
  the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
  made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
  Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
  You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
  direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
  executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the

  any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
  License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
  grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
  be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
  a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
  indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with

  only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
  behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
  reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

through
^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `through@2.3.8 <https://github.com/dominictarr/through>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  #through
  
  [![build status](https://secure.travis-
  ci.org/dominictarr/through.png)](http://travis-
  ci.org/dominictarr/through)
  [![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/through.png)](h
  ttps://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/through)
  
  Easy way to create a `Stream` that is both `readable` and `writable`.
  
  * Pass in optional `write` and `end` methods.
  * `through` takes care of pause/resume logic if you use
  `this.queue(data)` instead of `this.emit('data', data)`.
  * Use `this.pause()` and `this.resume()` to manage flow.
  * Check `this.paused` to see current flow state. (`write` always
  returns `!this.paused`).
  
  This function is the basis for most of the synchronous streams in
  [event-stream](http://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream).
  
  ``` js
  var through = require('through')
  
  through(function write(data) {
      this.queue(data) //data *must* not be null
    },
    function end () { //optional
      this.queue(null)
    })
  ```
  
  Or, can also be used _without_ buffering on pause, use
  `this.emit('data', data)`,
  and this.emit('end')
  
  ``` js
  var through = require('through')
  
  through(function write(data) {
      this.emit('data', data)
      //this.pause()
    },
    function end () { //optional
      this.emit('end')
    })
  ```
  
  ## Extended Options
  
  You will probably not need these 99% of the time.
  
  ### autoDestroy=false
  
  By default, `through` emits close when the writable
  and readable side of the stream has ended.
  If that is not desired, set `autoDestroy=false`.
  
  ``` js
  var through = require('through')
  
  //like this
  var ts = through(write, end, {autoDestroy: false})
  //or like this
  var ts = through(write, end)
  ts.autoDestroy = false
  ```

  # Underscore.string [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-
  ci.org/epeli/underscore.string.png?branch=master)](http://travis-
  ci.org/epeli/underscore.string) #
  
  Javascript lacks complete string manipulation operations.
  This is an attempt to fill that gap. List of build-in methods can be
  found
  for example from [Dive Into JavaScript][d].
  Originally started as an Underscore.js extension but is a full
  standalone
  library nowadays.
  
  Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x? Please read the [changelog][c].
  
  [c]: https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/blob/master/CHANGELOG.
  markdown#300
  
  ## Usage
  
  ### For Node.js, Browserify and Webpack
  
  Install from npm
  
      npm install underscore.string
  
  Require individual functions
  
  ```javascript
  var slugify = require("underscore.string/slugify");
  
  slugify("Hello world!");
  // => hello-world
  ```
  
  or load the full library to enable chaining
  
  ```javascript
  var s = require("underscore.string");
  
  s("   epeli  ").trim().capitalize().value();
  // => "Epeli"
  ```
  
  but especially when using with [Browserify][] the individual function
  approach
  is recommended because using it you only add those functions to your
  bundle you
  use.
  
  [Browserify]: http://browserify.org/
  
  ### In Meteor
  
  From your [Meteor][] project folder
  
  ```shell
      meteor add underscorestring:underscore.string
  ```
  
  and you'll be able to access the library with the ***s*** global from
  both the server and the client.
  
  ```javascript
  s.slugify("Hello world!");
  // => hello-world
  
  s("   epeli  ").trim().capitalize().value();
  // => "Epeli"
  ```
  
  [Meteor]: http://www.meteor.com/
  
  ### Others
  
  The `dist/underscore.string.js` file is an [UMD][] build. You can load
  it using
  an AMD loader such as [RequireJS][] or just stick it to a web page and
  access
  the library from the ***s*** global.
  
  [UMD]: https://github.com/umdjs/umd
  [RequireJS]: http://requirejs.org/
  
  ### Underscore.js/Lo-Dash integration
  
  It is still possible use as Underscore.js/Lo-Dash extension
  
  ```javascript
  _.mixin(s.exports());
  ```
  But it's not recommended since `include`, `contains`, `reverse` and
  `join`
  are dropped because they collide with the functions already defined by
  Underscore.js.
  
  ### Lo-Dash-FP/Ramda integration
  
  If you want to use underscore.string with
  [ramdajs](http://ramdajs.com/) or [Lo-Dash-
  FP](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-fp) you can use [underscore.strin
  g.fp](https://github.com/stoeffel/underscore.string.fp).
  
      npm install underscore.string.fp
  
  ```javascript
  var S = require('underscore.string.fp');
  var filter = require('lodash-fp').filter;
  var filter = require('ramda').filter;
  
  filter(S.startsWith('.'), [
    '.vimrc',
    'foo.md',
    '.zshrc'
  ]);
  // => ['.vimrc', '.zshrc']
  ```

  Splits a line `str` (default '') into several lines of size
  `options.width` (default 75) using a `options.seperator` (default
  '\n'). If `options.trailingSpaces` is true, make each line at least
  `width` long using trailing spaces. If `options.cut` is true, create
  new lines in the middle of words. If `options.preserveSpaces` is true,
  preserve the space that should be there at the end of a line (only
  works if options.cut is false).
  
  ```javascript
  wrap("Hello World", { width:5 })
  // => "Hello\nWorld"
  
  wrap("Hello World", { width:6, seperator:'.', trailingSpaces: true })
  // => "Hello .World "
  
  wrap("Hello World", { width:5, seperator:'.', cut:true,
  trailingSpaces: true })
  // => "Hello. Worl.d    "
  
  wrap("Hello World", { width:5, seperator:'.', preserveSpaces: true })
  // => "Hello .World"
  
  ```
  
  #### dedent(str, [pattern]) => string
  
  Dedent unnecessary indentation or dedent by a pattern.

  });
  // => "Hello world"
  
  map(12345, function(x) {
    return x;
  });
  // => "12345"
  
  map("Hello world", function(x) {
    if (x === 'o') x = 'O';
    return x;
  });
  // => "HellO wOrld"
  ```
  
  ### Library functions
  
  If you require the full library you can use chaining and aliases
  
  #### s(string) => chain
  
  Start a chain. Returns an immutable chain object with the string
  functions as
  methods which return a new chain object instead of the plain string
  value.
  
  The chain object includes also following native Javascript string
  methods:
  
    - [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
    - [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)
    - [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
    - [replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)
    - [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)
    - [substring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/R
  eference/Global_Objects/String/substring)
    - [substr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr)
    - [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
  US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/concat)
  
  #### chain.value()
  
  Return the string value from the chain
  
  ```javascript
  s("  foo  ").trim().capitalize().value();
  // => "Foo"
  ```
  
  When calling a method which does not return a string the resulting
  value is
  immediately returned
  
  ```javascript
  s(" foobar ").trim().startsWith("foo");
  // => true
  ```
  
  #### chain.tap(function) => chain
  
  Tap into the chain with a custom function
  
  ```javascript
  s("foo").tap(function(value){
    return value + "bar";
  }).value();
  // => "foobar"
  ```
  
  
  #### Aliases
  
  ```javascript
  strip     = trim
  lstrip    = ltrim
  rstrip    = rtrim
  center    = lrpad
  rjust     = lpad
  ljust     = rpad
  contains  = include
  q         = quote
  toBool    = toBoolean
  camelcase = camelize
  ```

win-spawn
^^^^^^^^^

The following software may be included in this product:

* `win-spawn@2.0.0 <https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn>`_

This software contains the following license and notice below: ::

  # win-spawn
  
    Spawn for node.js but in a way that works regardless of which OS
  you're using.  Use this if you want to use spawn with a JavaScript
  file.  It works by explicitly invoking node on windows.  It also shims
  support for environment variable setting by attempting to parse the
  command with a regex.  Since all modification is wrapped in `if (os
  === 'Windows_NT')` it can be safely used on non-windows systems and
  will not break anything.
  
  ## Installation
  
    $ npm install win-spawn
  
  ## Usage
  
  ### Command Line
  
    All the following will work exactly as if the 'win-spawn ' prefix
  was ommitted when on unix.
  
      $ win-spawn foo
      $ win-spawn ./bin/foo
      $ win-spawn NODE_PATH=./lib foo
      $ win-spawn NODE_PATH=./lib foo arg1 arg2
  
    You can also transform all the line endings in a directory from
  `\r\n` to `\n` just by running:
  
      $ win-line-endings
  
    You can preview the changes by running:
  
      $ win-line-endings -p
  
    It will ignore `node_modules` and `.git` by default, but is not
  clever enough to recognise binary files yet.
  
  ### API
  
  This will just pass through to `child_process.spawn` on unix systems,
  but will correctly parse the arguments on windows.
  
  ```javascript
  spawn('foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});
  spawn('./bin/foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});
  spawn('NODE_PATH=./lib foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});
  spawn('NODE_PATH=./lib foo', [arg1, arg2], {stdio: 'inherit'});
  ```
