  		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  
    This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
  your libraries, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  
    Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  
    Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.
  
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.
  
    The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.
  
    Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
  
    However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.
  
    Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".
  
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.
  
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.
  
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)
  
      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.
  
      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
  
      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.
  
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.
  
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
       Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).
  
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
      version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
      Library General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
      Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
      MA 02110-1301, USA
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

  2.	Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.   Subject to the terms and
  conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You
  accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and
  copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:
  
  2.1	Unmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally
  distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified
  copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes,
  provided that in each instance:
  
  (a)	You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
  copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear
  in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that
  refer to this License; and
  
  (b) 	You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code
  of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You
  may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict
  this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
  Section 6.
  
  2.2	Modified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce,
  display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and
  Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or
  non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of
  these conditions:
  
  (a)	You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
  Source Code of the Covered Code;
  
  (b)	You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
  in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and
  cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
  the files and the date of any change; and
  
  (c)	If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code
  of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom
  You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.  Source
  Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms
  set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
  below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12)
  months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You
  should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed
  Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).
  
  2.3	Distribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally
  Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code,
  executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself
  as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered
  Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and
  where to obtain such Source Code.
  
  2.4	Third Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although
  Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of
  the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
  Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
  intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor
  disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
  infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
  exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to
  distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Covered Code.
  
  3.	Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses
  granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity
  receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive,
  royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent
  Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
  controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense,
  distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and
  extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
  
  4.	Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
  with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
  Larger Work as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion
  thereof.
  
  5.	Limitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section
  2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
  Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.
  
  6.	Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights
  consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to
  one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
  behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
  Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional
  Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and
  hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or
  claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such
  Additional Terms.
  
  7.	Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new versions
  of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing
  version number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular
  version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
  version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
  subsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple
  has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
  License.
  
  8.	NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
  part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Code may
  contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete
  or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
  Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE
  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF
  ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE"
  FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
  ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF
  SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF
  QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH
  CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE
  COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR
  REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
  ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR
  WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED
  REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge
  that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear
  facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control
  machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death,
  personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
  
  9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
  EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
  INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
  YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
  UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS
  LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
  PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF
  LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT
  APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages
  (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the
  amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
  
  10.	Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the
  trademarks or trade names  "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime
  Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names
  belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service
  mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.  You agree not to use
  any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original
  Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
  than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with
  Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
  http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
  
  11.	Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
  Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications
  made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and
  to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple
  ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically
  subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
  such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
  contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
  
  12.	Termination.
  
  12.1	Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate:
  
  (a)	automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
  term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
  aware of such breach;
  (b)	immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
  13.5(b); or
  (c)	automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
  term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple;
  provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement
  against You in that instance.
  
  12.2	Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop
  any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
  the Covered Code.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly
  granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.
  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to
  Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any other
  for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of
  terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
  License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.
  
  13. 	Miscellaneous.
  
  13.1	Government End Users.   The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
  defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights in the
  Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
  defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data
  and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and
  12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR
  252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in
  Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly,
  all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
  forth herein.
  
  13.2	Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as
  creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal
  association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not
  represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
  otherwise.
  
  13.3	Independent Development.   Nothing in this License will impair Apple's
  right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
  distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions
  as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or
  products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.
  
  13.4	Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce
  any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
  of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides that the
  language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to
  this License.
  
  13.5	Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
  finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
  that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent
  permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties,
  and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You
  from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents
  the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately
  terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and
  destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.
  
  13.6	Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution between
  You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
  District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
  jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
  District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
  excluded.
  
  13.7	Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the entire
  agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This
  License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
  California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.
  
  Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause
  applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
  and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigÃ© que le
  prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.

  Creative Commons Legal Code
  
  CC0 1.0 Universal
  
      CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
      LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
      ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
      INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
      REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
      PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
      THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
      HEREUNDER.
  
  Statement of Purpose
  
  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
  exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
  and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
  authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
  
  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
  the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
  scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
  of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
  works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
  and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
  These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
  culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
  works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
  part through the use and efforts of others.
  
  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
  expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
  associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
  is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
  elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
  terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
  Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
  
  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
  protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
  Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
  limited to, the following:
  
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
       likeness depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
       in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
       protection of databases, and under any national implementation
       thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
       directive); and
  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
       world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
  
  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
  of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
  irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
  Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
  of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
  future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
  worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
  treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
  medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
  including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
  purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
  member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
  successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
  revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
  equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
  as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  
  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
  be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
  Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
  account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
  extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
  person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
  irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
  Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
  maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
  time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
  of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
  limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
  "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
  applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
  reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
  partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
  of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
  will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
  Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
  action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
  express Statement of Purpose.
  
  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
  
   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
      the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
      the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
      Work.
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
        identification within third-party archives.
