synopsis:        Various cryptographic hashes for bytestrings; CRC32 and Adler32 for now.
description:     This package provides efficient cryptographic hash implementations for  
                 strict and lazy bytestrings. For now, CRC32 and Adler32 are supported; 
                 they are implemented as FFI bindings to efficient code from zlib.
