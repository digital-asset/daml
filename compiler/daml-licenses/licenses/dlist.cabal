name:                   dlist
version:                0.8.0.5
synopsis:               Difference lists
description:
  Difference lists are a list-like type supporting O(1) append. This is
  particularly useful for efficient logging and pretty printing (e.g. with the
  Writer monad), where list append quickly becomes too expensive.
