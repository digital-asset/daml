                     These are useful for:
                     .
                     * Constraining the argument of a function to be a sorted list
                       by stating in your type that the input list is a sorted list.
                     .
                     * Avoiding sorting a list twice.
                     .
                     * Creating a list that is sorted from the moment of its construction,
                       so it doesn't have to be sorted later.
                     .
                     * Performing list operations keeping the input list sorted.
                     .
                     * Improving those list operations that can be
                       benefited from the ordering of its elements.
                     .
                     * Creating infinite lists that are sorted!
                     .
                     * And more!
                     .
