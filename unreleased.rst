HEAD — ongoing
--------------

- [DAML Docs] The ``damlc docs`` command now produces docs to a folder by default. Use the new ``--combine`` flag to output a single file instead.
- [DAML Docs] The ``damlc docs`` flag ``--prefix`` has been replaced with a ``--template`` flag which allows for a more flexible template.
- [DAML Docs] The ``damlc docs`` flag ``--json`` has been dropped in favor of ``--format=json``.
- [Java Bindings]: Add all packages of java bindings to the javadocs.
  See `#2280 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2280>`__.
