HEAD â€” ongoing
--------------

DAML Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The selected view for scenario results (table or transaction) is now
  preserved when the scenario results are updated.
  See `#1675 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1675>`__.

DAML Integration Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [DAML-LF] Rename ``none`` and ``some`` to ``optional_none`` and ``optional_some``, resp., in ``Expr`` and ``CasePat``.
- [Navigator] Contract details now show signatories and observers.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.
- [Scala Bindings] Reflect addition of signatories and observers to the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.
- [Java Codegen] Generated code supports signatories and observers as exposed by the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.
- [Java Bindings] Reflect addition of signatories and observers to the bindings.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.
- [Ledger API] Expose signatories and observers for a contract in ``CreatedEvent``.
  See `#1269 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1269>`__.
- [DAML Compiler] **BREAKING CHANGE**: Drop support for DAML-LF 1.4. Compiling to DAML-LF 1.5 should work without any code changes, although we highly recommend not specifying a target DAML-LF version at all. (The ledger server still supports DAML-LF 1.4.)
