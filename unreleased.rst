HEAD â€” ongoing
--------------

- [DAML Stdlib] Added the ``NumericScale`` typeclass, which improves the type inference for Numeric literals, and helps catch the creation of out-of-bound Numerics earlier in the compilation process.

- [DAML Triggers] ``emitCommands`` now accepts an additional argument
  that allows you to mark contracts as pending. Those contracts will
  be automatically filtered from the result of ``getContracts`` until
  we receive the corresponding completion/transaction.
