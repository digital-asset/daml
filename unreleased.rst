--------------

+ [Documentation] Added platform-independent tips for testing
+ [DAML Compiler] Some issues that caused ``damlc test`` to crash on shutdown have been fixed.
+ [DAML Compiler] The DAML compiler was accidentally compiled without
  optimizations on Windows. This has been fixed which should improve
  the performance of ``damlc`` and ``daml studio`` on Windows.
+ [DAML Compiler] ``damlc build`` should no longer leak file handles so
  ``ulimit`` workarounds should no longer be necessary.
+ [DAML-LF] **Breaking** Rename ``NUMERIC`` back to ``DECIMAL`` in Protobuf definition.
