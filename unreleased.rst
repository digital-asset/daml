Release notes
#############

This page contains release notes for the SDK.

HEAD â€” ongoing
--------------

+ [Sandbox] The sandbox now properly sets the connection pool properties ``minimumIdle``, ``maximumPoolSize``, and ``connectionTimeout``.
+ [Java codegen] Fix bug caused the generation of duplicate methods that affected sources with data constructors with type parameters that are either non-unique or not presented in the same order as in the corresponding data type declaration. See `#2367 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/2367>`__.
* [Dev Tooling] `daml-sdk-head` now installs current-workdir versions of all the published JARs (as version `100.0.0`) to the local Maven repo (`~/.m2`), to allow local testing of unreleased versions of the SDK against JVM-based applications. (Disable with `--skip-jars`)
