Release notes
#############

This page contains release notes for the SDK.

HEAD â€” ongoing
--------------

+ [Java Bindings] Add helper to prepare transformer for ``Bot.wire``. See `issue #3097 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/3097>`_.
+ [Ledger] The ledger api index server starts only after the indexer has finished initializing the database.
+ [DAML Standard Library] Add ``DA.Action.State`` module containing a ``State`` action that
  can be used for computations that modify a state variable.
+ [DAML Compiler] Fixed the location of interface files when the
  ``source`` field in ``daml.yaml`` points to a file. This is mainly
  important for when you want to use the created ``.dar`` in the
  ``dependencies`` field of another package.
  See `issue #3135 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/3135>`_.
+ [SQL Extractor] The format used for storing Optional and Map values found in contracts
  as JSON has been replaced with :doc:`/json-api/lf-value-specification`.  See `issue
  #3066 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/3066>`_ for specifics.
+ [Scala Codegen] Fixes for StackOverflowErrors in reading large LF archives. See `issue #3104 <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/3104>`_.
+ [Scala Bindings] Fixed a bug in the retry logic of ``LedgerClientBinding#retryingConfirmedCommands``. Commands are now only retried when the server responds with status ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`` or ``UNAVAILABLE``.

+ [DAML-SDK Docker Image] The image now contains a ``daml`` user and the SDK is installed to ``/home/daml/.daml``.
  ``/home/daml/.daml/bin`` is automatically added to ``PATH``.
