/** @param parallelism The number of submitSingleCommand invocations each trigger will attempt to execute in parallel.
  *                    Note that this does not in any way bound the number of already-submitted, but not completed,
  *                    commands that may be pending.
  * @param maxRetries Maximum number of retries when the ledger client fails an API command submission.
  * @param maxSubmissionRequests Used to control rate at which we throttle ledger client submission requests.
  * @param maxSubmissionDuration Used to control rate at which we throttle ledger client submission requests.
  * @param inFlightCommandBackPressureCount When the number of in-flight command submissions exceeds this value, then we
  *                                         enable Daml rule evaluation to apply backpressure (by failing emitCommands
  *                                         evaluations).
  * @param inFlightCommandOverflowCount When the number of in-flight command submissions exceeds this value, then we
  *                                     kill the trigger instance by throwing an InFlightCommandOverflowException.
  * @param allowInFlightCommandOverflows flag to control whether we allow in-flight command overflows or not.
  * @param submissionFailureQueueSize Size of the queue holding ledger API command submission failures.
  * @param maximumBatchSize Maximum number of messages triggers will batch (for rule evaluation/processing).
  * @param batchingDuration Period of time we will wait before emitting a message batch (for rule evaluation/processing).
  * @param maximumActiveContracts Maximum number of active contracts that we will store at any point in time.
