# use our nix-built ghc which is used in the `nix`/`cabal` worfklows, we want it
# to use its own LTS version. Setting this to `true` and then trying to run
# tests via `stack` inside the `nix-shell` will result in some cryptic package
# collison messages: e.g., there's a `text` in the nix-built ghc which are
# using, and another `text` in what `stack` wants to use.

# since this will rebuild a custom ghc often due to the structure of
# release.nix, it is suggested that `nix-shell release.nix -A grpc-haskell.env`
# is used and then `stack test` (sans `--nix`) is used during development and
# test iterations.
