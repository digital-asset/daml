  /** Returns a `Source` that can be fed via the materialized queue.

    * The queue length counter can at most be eventually consistent due to
    * the counter increment and decrement operation being scheduled separately
    * and possibly not in the same order as the actual enqueuing and dequeueing
    * of items.
    *
    * For this reason, you may also read values on the saturation counter which
    * are negative or exceed `bufferSize`.
    *
    * Note that the fact that the count is decremented in a second operator means
    * that its buffering will likely skew the measurements to be greater than the
    * actual value, rather than the other way around.
    *
    * We track the queue capacity as a counter as we may want to aggregate
    * the metrics for multiple individual queues of the same kind and we want to be able
    * to decrease the capacity when the queue gets completed.
