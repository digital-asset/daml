# Overview
This document is to help internal engineers work with the Sandbox and the new ledger API.
Note: If you encounter bugs. Please report issues you find in the #team-ledger-api channel.

# DAML Sandbox

To build a fat JAR with the sandbox built from HEAD run

    bazel build //ledger/sandbox:sandbox-binary_deploy.jar

Sandbox application can be run from command line with the following command:

    java -jar bazel-bin/ledger/sandbox/sandbox-binary_deploy.jar [options] <archive>

as run from the main project root directory (adjust the location of the JAR according to your working directory).

## Command line arguments

```
  -p, --port <value>       Sandbox service port. Defaults to 6865.
  -a, --address <value>    Sandbox service host. Defaults to binding on all addresses.
  --dalf                   Parse provided archives as DAML-LF Archives instead of DARs.
  --static-time            Use static time, configured with TimeService through gRPC.
  -w, --wall-clock-time    Use wall clock time (UTC). When not provided, static time is used.
  -o, --sim-time-offset <value>
                           Use simulated time with the given duration (ISO-8601 with optional `-` prefix) as offset relative to UTC. For example, supplying `-PT6M` will result in the server time lagging behind UTC by 6 minutes. When not provided, static time is used.
  --no-parity              Disables Ledger Server parity mode. Features which are not supported by the Platform become available.
  --scenario <value>       If set, the sandbox will execute the given scenario on startup and store all the contracts created by it.
  --daml-lf-archive-recursion-limit <value>
                           Set the recursion limit when decoding DAML-LF archives (.dalf files). Default is 1000
  <archive>...             Daml archives to load. Only DAML-LF v1 Archives are currently supported.
  --pem <value>            TLS: The pem file to be used as the private key
  --crt <value>            TLS: The crt file to be used as the cert chain. Required if any other TLS parameters are set.
  --cacrt <value>          TLS: The crt file to be used as the the trusted root CA.
  --help                   Print the usage text
```

# Compatibility

Sandbox uses models compiled in to the DAR format.

Note that the new Ledger API only supports DAML 1.0 or above codebases compiled to DAML-LF v1. Again, using the DAML packaging as suggested above will ensure that you are generating dar files that the Sandbox can consume.

# Ledger API

The new Ledger API uses gRPC. If you just want to create / exercise contracts, I suggest you start by looking at [`command_service.proto`](/ledger-api/grpc-definitions/com/daml/ledger/api/v1/command_service.proto), which exposes a synchronous API to the DAML ledger.

# Logging

You can enable debug logging in Sandbox with `sandbox-log-level` system property:

    $ java -jar ./bazel-bin/ledger/sandbox/sandbox-binary_deploy.jar --log-level=DEBUG $PWD/bazel-bin/ledger/sandbox/Test.dar

Or when started from Bazel with:

    $ bazel run //ledger/sandbox:sandbox-binary -- --log-level=DEBUG $PWD/bazel-bin/ledger/sandbox/Test.dar

# Profiling

You can enable profiling in Sandbox by passing a directory where the profiling
information should be written via the `--profile-dir` flag, e.g.
```shell
$ bazel run //ledger/sandbox:sandbox-binary -- --profile-dir=/write/profiles/here/ ...
```

**DISCLAIMER**: Profiling is not intended to be used in production setups since
it slows down DAML execution significantly and writes a lot of profiling
information to disk.

For every command submitted to the Sandbox, a JSON file named like
`<submission time>-<command description>-<seed>.json` is written to the
directory specified via `--profile-dir`. In this file name,
`<command description>` is a string of the form `create:TemplateName` or
`exercise:TemplateName:ChoiceName`.

These JSON files can be viewed using the
[speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/) flamegraph visualizer. The easiest
way to install speedscope is to run
```shell
$ npm install -g speedscope
```
See the [Offline usage](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope#usage) section of
its documentation for alternatives.

Once speedscope is installed, a specific profile can be viewed via
```shell
$ speedscope /path/to/profile.json
```
