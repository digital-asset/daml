**TODO DPP-418**: Replace references to this private gist:   
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pbatko-da/c83dff8ee8b7eb074b91694bbc7e7e01/raw/e5e069a9676a074dde71cf9f19cf0c4172ec3532/server-pem-decryption-parameters.json  
with an Github url to the `ledger/test-common/files/server-pem-decryption-parameters.json` file on the `main` branch.  
We can't do it right now because this change needs to merged into `main` branch first.

**NOTE**: Decryption details in `ledger/test-common/files/server-pem-decryption-parameters.json` 
must be kept in sync with the encryption command usd in `ledger/test-common/test-certificates/BUILD.bazel`
