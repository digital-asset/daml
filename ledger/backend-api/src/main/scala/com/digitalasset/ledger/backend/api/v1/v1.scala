/** Version 1 of the Ledger Backend API.
  *
  * The main class is [[com.digitalasset.ledger.backend.api.v1.LedgerBackend]]. It abstracts over different means for
  * reading and writing from a ledger; and thereby allow providing the DAML Ledger API on a variety of backends.
  * See the documentation of [[com.digitalasset.ledger.backend.api.v1.LedgerBackend]] for details.
  *
  * We are in the process of simplifying and streamlining the implementation of LedgerBackends. We aim to do that by
  * publishing additional versions of this API side-by-side with the existing ones and migration information. Similar to
  * how Microsoft's DirectX evolved.
  *
  * The V1 API is stable insofar as it will not change, but it may be deprecated at any time in favor of a V2 version.
  * If you use it make sure that your stability needs and migration plans are known to DA.
