/** An instance of the [[LedgerBackend]] trait allows to read from and write
  * to a DAML Ledger.
  *
  * The purpose of the [[LedgerBackend]] trait is to decouple the
  * implementation of the ledger-api-server, which provides the user-facing
  * DAML Ledger API, from the implementation of the underlying storage and
  * synchronization mechanism. The ledger-api-server can thereby be used to
  * offer the DAML Ledger API for many different distributed ledger and
  * database technologies.
  *
  * The semantics of DAML Ledgers are specified as part of the DA Ledger
  * model: https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/index.html. We assume
  * knowledge of the concepts explained therein for the remainder of this
  * documentation. We also recommend going through the Getting Started Guide
  * in the DAML SDK to get a feel for how a DAML Application works:
  * https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html
  *
  * The [[LedgerBackend]] trait is structured such that it can also be
  * implemented for distributed ledgers where each node has its own local view
  * on the state of the ledger and on what transactions have been accepted.
  *
  * The [[LedgerBackend]] trait exposes changes to a Participant node's state
  * as a stream of [[LedgerSyncEvent]]s. Not all changes are required to be
  * exposed. Only the ones observable at the level of the DAML Ledger API. Use
  * [[LedgerBackend.ledgerSyncEvents]] to consume this stream. Every
  * [[LedgerSyncEvent]] has an associated [[LedgerSyncOffset]], which serves
  * as a Participant-node-local address of that event. This allows consuming
  * the [[LedgerSyncOffset.ledgerSyncEvents]] stream starting after a specific
  * offset.
  *
  * Participant nodes often host the data for multiple DAML Parties; i.e.,
  * they run in a multi-tenancy setup. The privacy model for DAML
  * (https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/ledger-privacy.html) is
  * though defined on a per-party basis. This is why all methods that read
  * privacy-sensitive data from a Participant node take the requesting
  * party(ies) as an argument; see e.g., [[LedgerBackend.ledgerSyncEvents]].
  * The implementors of [[LedgerBackend]] need to take care to properly filter
  * the returned data to only include the requesting parties view.
  *
  * TODO (SM): move the per-party filtering into the domain of the
  * ledger-api-server as part of the V2 version of the LedgerBackend API
  *
  * In principle, all reads from a Participant node's state can be performed
  * using [[LedgerBackend.ledgerSyncEvents]] and computing the desired result
  * over the returned stream. However this would not perform well, which is why
  * we added extra methods to the [[LedgerBackend]] where desirable.
  *
  * All writes to the ledger happen by submitting a transaction using
  * [[LedgerBackend.beginSubmission]] and calling [[SubmissionHandle.submit]]
  * on the returned [[SubmissionHandle]]. It is expected that a Participant
  * node coordinates with the other nodes constituting the ledger to commit
  * the submitted transaction and inform the relevant Participant nodes about
  * the newly committed transaction.
