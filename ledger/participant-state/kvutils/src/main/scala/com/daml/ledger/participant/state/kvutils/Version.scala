/** This file defines the version of the protocol buffer messages,
  * and the changelog of kvutils.
  *
  * Changes:
  * [after 100.13.39]:
  * - logEntryToAsyncResponse has now been removed as all requests
  *   now have event based responses.
  *
  * [after 100.13.37]:
  * - Removed DamlConfiguration in favour of participant-state's LedgerConfiguration.
  * - Authorization of configuration changes is now based on validating against the participant id
  *   of the previously submitted configuration.
  *
  * [after 100.13.29]:
  * - Add support for ledger dumps via environment variable: "KVUTILS_LEDGER_DUMP=/tmp/ledger.dump".
  * - Add integrity checker tool to verify ledger dumps for validating compatibility of new versions.
  *
  * [after 100.13.26]:
  * - Added metrics to track submission processing.
  * - Use InsertOrdMap to store resulting state in kvutils for deterministic ordering of state key-values.
  * - Fix bug with transient contract keys, e.g. keys created and archived in same transaction.
  *
  * [after 100.13.21]:
  * - Added 'Envelope' for compressing and versioning kvutils messages that are transmitted
  *   or stored on disk. [[Envelope.enclose]] and [[Envelope.open]] should be now used for
  *   submissions and for results from processing them.
  * - Disabled the time-to-live checks for ledger effective time and record time. The
  *   time model is being redesigned and the checks will be reimplemented once we have
  *   the new design.
  *
  * [after 100.13.16]: *BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE*
  * - Log entries are no longer used as inputs to submission processing. The
  *   contract instance is now stored within DamlContractStatus.
  * - Configuration extended with "Open World" flag that defines whether
  *   submissions from unallocated parties are accepted.
  * - Support for authenticating submissions based on participant id. The
  *   [[KeyValueCommitting.processSubmission]] method now takes the participant id as
  *   argument.
  * - Support for submitting authenticated configuration changes.
  * - Bug in command deduplication fixed: rejected commands are now deduplicated correctly.

  /** The kvutils version number. Packing kvutils messages into envelopes carries the version number.
    * Version should be incremented when semantics of fields change and migration of data is required or
    * when the protobuf default value for a field is insufficient and must be filled in during decoding.
    * Handling of older versions is handled by [[Envelope.open]] which performs the migration to latest version.
