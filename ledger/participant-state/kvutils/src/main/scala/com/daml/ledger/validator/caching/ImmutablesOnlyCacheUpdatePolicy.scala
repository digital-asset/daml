  * Cache update policy that allows writing to-be-committed packages back to the cache and read

  * This policy should be used for ledgers with multiple committers.
  * In case a commit fails and hence does not get persisted e.g. because of a conflicting write set
  * with another commit, this policy ensures that we don't need to invalidate items in the cache.
  * Specifically, packages are content-addressed hence may be cached without consistency issues,
  * whereas party allocations must be only cached once they are available on the ledger.
