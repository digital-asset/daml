  *   The ledger may choose to perform additional (cross-participant)
  *   command deduplication. If it chooses to do so, it must follow the
  *   same rules as the participant:
  *   - Deduplication is based on the (submitter, commandId) tuple.
  *   - Commands must not be deduplicated after the `deduplicateUntil` time has passed.
  *   - Commands should not be deduplicated after the command was rejected.
