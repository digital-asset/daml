/** Interfaces to read from and write to an (abstract) participant state.
  *
  * A DAML ledger participant is code that allows to actively participate in
  * the evolution of a shared DAML ledger. Each such participant maintains a
  * particular view onto the state of the DAML ledger. We call this view the
  * participant state.
  *
  * Actual implementations of a DAML ledger participant will likely maintain
  * more state than what is exposed through the interfaces in this package,
  * which is why we talk about an abstract participant state. It abstracts
  * over the different implementations of DAML ledger participants.
  *
  * This is version v2 of the [[com.daml.ledger.participant.state]]
  * interfaces.
  * - v1 is kept as is to serve the needs of //ledger/api-server-damlonx.
  * It will be deprecated and dropped as soon as Sandbox ledger API server
  * becomes a common backbone of all daml-on-x implementations.
  * - v2 is under development and evolving to serve the needs of merging the
  * Sandbox ledger API server with the DAML on X API server as per
  * https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1273
  *
  * The interfaces are optimized for easy implementation. The
  * [[v2.WriteService]] interface contains the methods for changing the
  * participant state (and potentially the state of the DAML ledger), which
  * all ledger participants must support. These methods are for example
  * exposed via the DAML Ledger API. Actual ledger participant implementations
  * likely support more implementation-specific methods. They are however not
  * exposed via the DAML Ledger API. The [[v2.ReadService]] interface contains
  * the one method [[v2.ReadService.stateUpdates]] to read the state of a ledger
  * participant. It represents the participant state as a stream of
  * [[v2.Update]]s to an initial participant state. The typical consumer of this
  * method is a class that subscribes to this stream of [[v2.Update]]s and
  * reconstructs (a view of) the actual participant state. See the comments
  * on [[v2.Update]] and [[v2.ReadService.stateUpdates]] for details about the kind
  * of updates and the guarantees given to consumers of the stream of
  * [[v2.Update]]s.
