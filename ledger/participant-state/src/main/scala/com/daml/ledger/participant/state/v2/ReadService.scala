/** An interface for reading the state of a ledger participant.
  * '''Please note that this interface is unstable and may significantly change.'''
  *
  * The state of a ledger participant is communicated as a stream of state
  * [[Update]]s. That stream is accessible via [[ReadService!.stateUpdates]].
  * Commonly that stream is processed by a single consumer that keeps track of
  * the current state and creates indexes to satisfy read requests against
  * that state.
  *
  * See [[com.daml.ledger.participant.state.v2]] for further architectural
  * information. See [[Update]] for a description of the state updates
  * communicated by [[ReadService!.stateUpdates]].

  /** Get the stream of state [[Update]]s starting from the beginning or right
    * after the given [[Offset]]
    *
    * This is where the meat of the implementation effort lies. Please take your time
    * to read carefully through the properties required from correct implementations.
    * These properties fall into two categories:
    *
    * 1. properties about the sequence of [[(Offset, Update)]] tuples
    *    in a stream read from the beginning, and
    * 2. properties relating the streams obtained from separate calls
    *   to [[ReadService.stateUpdates]].
    *
    * The first class of properties are invariants of a single stream:
    *
    * - *strictly increasing [[Offset]]s*:
    *   for any two consecutive tuples `(o1, u1)` and `(o2, u2)`, `o1` is
    *   strictly smaller than `o2`.
    *
    * - *initialize before transaction acceptance*: before any
    *   [[Update.TransactionAccepted]], there is a [[Update.ConfigurationChanged]] update
    *   and [[Update.PublicPackageUpload]] updates for all packages referenced by
    *   the [[Update.TransactionAccepted]].
    *
    * - *causal monotonicity*: given a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] with an associated
    *   ledger time `lt_tx`, it holds that `lt_tx >= lt_c` for all `c`, where `c` is a
    *   contract used by the transaction and `lt_c` the ledger time of the
    *   [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] that created the contract.
    * The ledger time of a transaction is specified in the corresponding [[TransactionMeta]]
    * meta-data.
    * Note that the ledger time of unrelated updates is not necessarily monotonically
    * increasing.
    * The creating transaction need not have a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] even on this participant
    * if the participant does not host a stakeholder of the contract, e.g., in the case of divulgence.
    *
    * - *time skew*: given a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] with an associated
    * ledger time `lt_tx` and a record time `rt_tx`, it holds that
    * `rt_TX - minSkew <= lt_TX <= rt_TX + maxSkew`, where `minSkew` and `maxSkew`
    * are parameters specified in the ledger [[com.daml.ledger.configuration.LedgerTimeModel]]
    * of the last [[Update.ConfigurationChanged]] before the [[Update.TransactionAccepted]].
    *
    * - *command deduplication*: Let there be a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] with [[CompletionInfo]]
    * or a [[Update.CommandRejected]] with [[CompletionInfo]] and [[Update.CommandRejected.definiteAnswer]] at offset `off2`
    * and let `off1` be the completion offset where the [[CompletionInfo.optDeduplicationPeriod]] starts.
    * Then there is no other [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] with [[CompletionInfo]] for the same [[CompletionInfo.changeId]]
    * between the offsets `off1` and `off2` inclusive.
    *
    *   So if a command submission has resulted in a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]],
    *   other command submissions with the same [[SubmitterInfo.changeId]] must be deduplicated
    *   if the earlier's [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] falls within the latter's [[CompletionInfo.optDeduplicationPeriod]].
    *
    *   Implementations MAY extend the deduplication period from [[SubmitterInfo]] arbitrarily
    *   and reject a command submission as a duplicate even if its deduplication period does not include
    *   the earlier's [[Update.TransactionAccepted]].
    *   A [[Update.CommandRejected]] completion does not trigger deduplication and implementations SHOULD
    *   process such resubmissions normally.
    *
    * - *finality*: If the corresponding [[WriteService]] acknowledges a submitted transaction or rejection
    *   with [[SubmissionResult.Acknowledged]], the [[ReadService]] SHOULD make sure that
    *   it eventually produces a [[Update.TransactionAccepted]] or [[Update.CommandRejected]] with the corresponding [[CompletionInfo]],
    *   even if there are crashes or lost network messages.
    *
    * The second class of properties relates multiple calls to [[ReadService.stateUpdates]] to each other.
    * The class contains two properties:
    * (1) a property that enables crash-fault tolerant Ledger API server implementations and
    *  (2) a property that enables Ledger API server implementations that are synchronized by a backing ledger.
    *
    * For crash-fault-tolerance, we require an implementation of [[ReadService.stateUpdates]] to support its consumer to
    * resume consumption starting after the last offset up to which the consumer completed processing.
    * Note that this offset can be before the offset of several of the latest delivered [[Update]]s in case the consumer
    * did not complete their processing before crashing.
    *
    * Formally, we require that the above invariants also hold for any sequence of offset-and-update pairs
    *
    *   `us = takeUntilOffset(us_1, o_2) + takeUntilOffset(us_2, o_3) + ... + takeUntilOffset(us_N-1, o_N) + us_N`
    *
    * where `us_i =` [[ReadService.stateUpdates(o_i)]] and `lastOffsetOf(us_i) >= o_i+1`. Here, `us_i` is the sequence
    * of offset-and-update pairs sourced from a call to [[ReadService.stateUpdates]] and the side-condition formalizes
    * that later calls must start from an offset before or equal to the last offset delivered in the previous call.
    *
    * For synchronization, we require that two parties hosted on separate participant nodes are in sync
    * on transaction nodes and contracts that they can both see. The more formal definition
    * is based on the notion of projections of transactions
    * (see https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/ledger-privacy.html), as follows.
    *
    * Assume that there is
    * - a party `A` hosted at participant `p1`,
    * - a party `B` hosted at participant `p2`, and
    * - an accepted transaction with identifier `tid` evidenced to both participants `p1` and `p2`
    *   in their state update streams after the [[Update.PartyAddedToParticipant]] updates for
    *   `A`, respectively `B`.
    * The projections of `tx1` and `tx2` to the nodes visible to both `A` and `B` is the same.
    *
    * Note that the transaction `tx1` associated to `tid` on `p1` is not required to be the same as
    * the transaction `tx2` associated to `tid` on `p2`, as these two participants do not necessarily
    * host the same parties; and some implementations ensure data segregation on the ledger. Requiring
    * only the projections to sets of parties to be equal leaves just enough leeway for this
    * data segregation.
    *
    * Note further that the offsets of the transactions might not agree, as these offsets are participant-local.
