    * As this interface applies only to the local participant unlike other administrator services, returns a
    * (completion stage of a) PruningResult rather than a SubmissionResult.
    *
    * Ledgers that do not elect to support participant pruning, return NotPruned(Status.UNIMPLEMENTED). Returning an
    * error also keeps the ledger api server from pruning its index.
    *
    * Ledgers whose participants hold no participant-local state, but want the ledger api server to prune, return
    * ParticipantPruned.
    *
    * For pruning implementations to be fault tolerant, the following aspects are important:
    * - Consider failing a prune request before embarking on destructive operations for example if certain safety
    *   conditions are not met (such as being low on resources). This helps minimize the chances of partially performed
    *   prune operations. If the system cannot prune up to the specified offset, the call should not alter the system
    *   and return NotPruned rather than prune partially.
    * - Implement pruning either atomically (performing all operations or none), or break down pruning steps into
    *   idempotent pieces that pick up after retries or system recovery in case of a mid-pruning crash.
    * - To the last point, be aware that pruning of the ledger api server index happens in such an idempotent follow-up
    *   step upon successful completion of each prune call. To reach eventual consistency upon failures, be sure
    *   to return ParticipantPruned even if the specified offset has already been pruned to allow ledger api server
    *   index pruning to proceed in case of an earlier failure.
