  * @param trackerRetentionPeriod
  *        The duration that the command service will keep an active command tracker for a given set
  *        of parties. A longer period cuts down on the tracker instantiation cost for a party that
  *        seldom acts. A shorter period causes a quick removal of unused trackers.
